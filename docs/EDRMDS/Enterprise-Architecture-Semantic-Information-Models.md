# Enterprise Architecture - Semantic Information Models

### Main strategy

- Tight feedback loop
  - Tool enforced (modeling tool(s))
- Put the pains close to the one who generates noise and inconsistency
- Introduce semantic in the information bricks, traceability through the emtamodels and transformations, and freedom (with introduced pain) in the context specific models
  - Use Policy Advisory Board concept to resolve the fights
