# EDRMDS - a less is more approach to SOA Master Data Management

## Intro

Service Oriented Architecture is all over us. There seems to be some kind of consensus that one type of SOA services are services that are responsible for the core business objects - and vendors are monitoring and releasing their SOA Data Server products to close the gap. By pioneering the SOA space with EDR, we have gained lots of valuable of experiences of how to solve the Master Data challenges in SOA.

This talk will discuss the main contenders for the ownership of your business objects definitions, and comment on their consequences - and then follow up with a "less is more" approach to enable companies to gain the combined advantages of all the platforms by extending the EDR pattern to also include Master Data Service (MDS) features.

|  | Catchphrase: **The Lean, agile, low cost approach to MDM covering the simplest of scenarios to Enterprise Complexity** |

**EDR**

The Enterprise Domain Repository (EDR) pattern recognizes that we are still in the stone age of data integration.
