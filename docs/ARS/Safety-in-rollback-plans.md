# Safety in rollback plans

Projects that go for a big bang release strategy will often plan on having a rollback plan in case the release fails. As the release date draws closer and the details of the rollback plan are explored the project comes to the realization that a rollback is not feasible. It is simply to complex to revert all the changes made during the release process. This will often lead to the release date being pushed back in order to give the project time to verify the release plan.
