# Pain relievers

A pain reliever is anything that compensates a user for the discomfort of having to work with a release that lacks a number of important features. Examples of pain relievers are:

- Money  
  Give customers cash, coupons or some other kind of money as compensation. This works best if combined with [Limited releases](/web/20090928081629/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/ARS/Limited+releases "Limited releases").
- Promotion  
  Give a group of employees that will use a [Limited release](/web/20090928081629/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/ARS/Limited+release "Limited release") expanded authority or some other kind of promotion.
- Discounts  
  Reduce the price of the products being sold.
