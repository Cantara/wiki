# Principles and patterns

There are a multitude of strategies that can be used to reduce the length of a release. These strategies can be described either as principles or patterns. **A principle is a rule that you can choose to follow to a greater or lesser degree**. Principles are like good advice. You should always take these principles into consideration but sometimes your context will make a principle less relevant. **A pattern is usually defined as a solution to a problem in a context.** If your context does not match the context of the pattern you will probably not be able to use it. Patterns can be combined. They also have intrinsic strengths and weaknesses that need to be evaluated in the context of your project.

**Have you used principles or patterns that are not described here? Please contribute your experiences!**
