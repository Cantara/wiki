# Automate releases

If every release has a large chance of error due to clumsy operators or bad documentation, releasing frequently becomes suicidal.

Make sure that the release process open for a little human error as possible. First, make sure the documentation and routines are simple and have no unnecessary steps. Second, try to automate as much as the release procedure as possible.

A good way to make sure the documentation is correct and the automation works is to try it out multiple times in a development environment. (Eat your own medicine). (Do we really have to tell you this?)

Further ideas:
- Make sure errors are visible (hard failure)
