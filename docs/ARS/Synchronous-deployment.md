# Synchronous deployment

## Problem/Context
When upgrading or replacing multiple systems that are interconnected. 

## Solution
Deploy an upgrade to all of the systems at the same time.

## Strengths
- Freedom to make changes in one system that depend on changes in one of the other systems.
 
## Weaknesses
- There is a very high cost associated with getting the new versions of all the involved systems completed at the same time.
