# Minimize releases in production

## Problem/Context
A system is deployed at multiple sites. The decision to upgrade to a newer version is not centralized. A common example of this is software that is sold to multiple customers and installed locally. Different versions of the system are used at different sites.

## Solution
- Reduce the cost and risk of upgrading. Relevant patterns are [Automate releases](Automate-releases.md), [Automate database migrations](Automate-database-migrations.md) and [Sanity check versions](Sanity-check-versions.md)
- Increase visible value of new release. A good pattern for this is [Differentiators](Differentiators.md).
