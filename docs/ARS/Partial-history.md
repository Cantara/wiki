# Partial history - Cantara Community Wiki

## Problem/Context

In a [Replacement project](/web/20090930020647/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/ARS/Replacement+project "Replacement project") the existing system contains large amounts of historical information. Much of this information is not in active use but must be available for reference.

## Solution

Only migrate information that is actively used. Once the new system can handle ongoing business the existing system is made into a read only system for future reference.

## Strengths

- Less data needs to be migrated

## Weaknesses

- Historical reporting will be more difficult unless a data warehouse is used to combine data from both old and new system.
