# Differentiators

A differentiator i a feature that is so desirable that users will be willing to use the system even if it has very limited functionality in other areas. Identifying differentiators often requires innovative thinking that redefines the problem area.

A classic example of a differentiator is the Nintedo Wii. When the game consol came to market it was in most respects technically inferior to its competitors, but it succeeded because of its innovative controlling device.
