# "It won't work here"

Most people, whan asked, agree that releasing often is a good thing. Unfortunately, most people will also say that in their particular project it is not possible to release often. The reasons they provide will vary but often there is an underlying assumption that a great deal of functionality must be developed before anything can be released. Replacement projects are particularly prone to this kind of thinking, often driven by promises of [painless transition](painless-transition.md) and big bang release strategies.
