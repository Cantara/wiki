# Customer by customer - Cantara Community Wiki

## Problem/Context

In a [Replacement project](/web/20090930074312/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/ARS/Replacement+project "Replacement project") where the existing system is based around customer accounts.

## Solution

Develop just enough features to be able to migrate a small number of customers of one type. After that customers are migrated in increments.

## Strengths

- If there is a large variation in features that are needed for different types of customer this pattern reduces [MDE](/web/20090930074312/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/ARS/MDE "MDE") significantly

## Weaknesses

- This pattern does not work well if a customer of one type suddenly can change into another type.

## Examples

- Banking systems
- Insurance systems
