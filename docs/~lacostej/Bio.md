A bit about me.

French, living in Norway since 1998 (all my professional career). Software engineers interested in all aspects of it. A bit of focus on automation, test and quality.
Worked on various kinds of systems (web sites, server side, client side, networking libraries, etc).

In the past years, I've touched a few web projects, and I am interested in learning about HTML5 as much as possible to be able to take feature & design decisions. And to have fun as well.
