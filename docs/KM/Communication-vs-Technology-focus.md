# Communication vs Technology focus - Cantara Community Wiki

**TODO**:

diagram:

x-axis: communication in percent (one team, multiple teams, organization)   
y-axis: technology / tech work  
Put the different roles into the diagram to give a visual feeling for how the relate to each other.

PS: A VENN-diagram is worthless, since the roles overlap too much and are too imprecisely defined.
