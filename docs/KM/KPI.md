# KPI

### A wider perspective on KPI

It's tempting when trying to be customer-centric to focus on delivering lots of functionality quickly. Supposedly features win the race and can increase revenue, but is that all that matters? Evidence such as the troubles Twitter have had in the past and this anecdote from Google about search time suggests there are other qualities of our website that matter like:

    * Service charges
    * Responsiveness
    * Availability
    * Quality of interaction

Whilst these qualities are all about the customer experience, success in maintaining them at an appropriate level is related to how well a company performs internally:

    * It's undesirable to be charging excessively to cover development inefficiencies caused for example, by a tightly coupled architecture that makes even a small change a multi-month death-march.
    * A service that runs slow at peak times due to insufficient focus in our architecture and code on performance and scaling, appears sluggish or even down which can drive customers away.
    * Prolonged outages as the result of trivial problems occurring that take operational staff excessive time to fix because of poor monitoring and diagnostic tools, will impact customer satisfaction.
    * If we routinely rollback upgrades or they're brittle or bug-ridden we will negatively impact the quality of interaction.

Thus being more customer-centric requires a company to quantify it's performance and work to improve it. In the case of the examples above, things like response time, site downtime, number of failed upgrades, time to perform a release, bug counts and feature count against cost of delivery can be used as metrics to indicate how we're doing in our mission to make the customer happy.
