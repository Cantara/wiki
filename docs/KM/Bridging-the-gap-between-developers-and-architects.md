# Bridging the gap between developers and architects

###### Technology related policies

Architects often introduce policies to constrain what technology the development team can use.   
Examples:

- require that all applications *must* use the Spring IoC container.
- require that only Spring 1.2.x can be used, not for example 2.5
- only axis 1.1
- etc.

Can anyone give me an example where this *is* a good idea?   
If not, why do such policies exist?

Are there other technology related policies which *do* make sense? E.g. is it wise to restrict the number of programming languages used within an organization? (to reduce training and maintenance)

###### The architect is too far from the team / the architect meddles too much or too little

Which role has this architect? If her role is within the *organization* scope, it is not her job to be very visible within a single project. Perhaps someone should be assigned a tech-lead role?

Precise and well-defined roles, responsibilities and communication channels is the way to approach this problem.

###### Hard to give feedback to the architect (PAB?)

Perhaps introducing a coordinating architect which can communicate to the PAB on behalf of the tech leads is a good idea?

###### Dictator

Yes, in the end one role is responsible for making a decision. HOWEVER, it is probably not appropriate to make all decisions alone. Discussions and feedback is always important to learn and improve. While *one* person is assigned the responsibility of making the final decision, a *team* of architects can do the work, discuss and propose solutions.

###### Control freaks

An organization architect cannot and should not make low-level implementation decisions. Project architects in turn must adhere to the general architecture created by the organization architects. In other words, the scope of each architect role must be defined.
