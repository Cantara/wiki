# scale high processing or high computational in the client

### Case

SETI - search for patterns in massive data-sets from observations.

### Approaches

Compute: Add computational execution to the clients running in the background.  Process: Add P2P aggregation/concentration into the client "mesh"

### Consequences

Computational grid of un-deterministic size and quality. Lots of resubmits. Works only for problems which we can break into high computational effort on low to medium size of data as of bandwidth.
