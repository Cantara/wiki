# Architect categorization

We use **[Organizational Architect](Organizational-Architect.md)** to classify software architects which are responsible for the organizational context, i.e. across projects and products. These architects are commonly called _Chief Architects, Enterprise Architects, Solution Architect, System Architects, Integration Architects_ or _Infrastructure Architects_. 

We use **[Project Architect](Project-Architect.md)** to classify architects who work on a specific project and _within_ a project scope. These architects are commonly called _Solution architects, Software architects_ or _Tech leads_. 

We use **[Product Architect](Product<sub>~Architect.md)** to classify architects who work on a specific product and _within_ the product lifeline scope. Commonly used names for such architects are: Chief Product Architect, Product Architect, System Architect, Sub</sub>~system Architect, Build Architect or _Tech leads_.
