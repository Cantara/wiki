# Reporting

some key questions...

- Domain model DB or BI/reporting DB schema?

- Who do create the _reports_?  Customers, BI/DW department or developers?

- Data-volume, load and availability?  (In-house, sourced or SaaS/PaaS)

- Reporting as a event-provider for value-add apps?

- Push or poll clients to data-set?

- Evolve-ability and change-rate of data-sources?
