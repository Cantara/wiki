# Software Orthogonality

This is related to the DRY principle and [Totto's axiom on responsibility](Clear<sub>~and</sub><sub>consistent</sub><sub>responsibility</sub><sub>power</sub><sub>all</sub>~great-architectures.md).

The concept is explained well in [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.pragprog.com/the<sub>~pragmatic</sub>~programmer):

In computing, the term has come to signify a kind of independence or decoupling. Two or more things are orthogonal if changes in one do not affect any of the others. In a  well-designed system, the database code will be orthogonal to the user interface: you can change the interface without affecting the database, and swap databases without changing the interface.

Rather than elaborate on the concept here, we point to a [discussion between Dave Thomas, Andy Hunt and Bill Venners on Orthogonality and DRY](http://www.artima.com/intv/dry.html).

There's a small [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality#Computer_science) on the subject.
