# Value Object

"An object that represents a descriptive aspect of the domain with no conceptual identity is called a VALUE OBJECT." [smidigtonull:Evans 2003](../smidigtonull/Evans-2003.md)

See [this blog](http://stochastyk.blogspot.com/2008/05/value-objects-in-domain-driven-design.html) for some good advice on implementing Value Objects.
