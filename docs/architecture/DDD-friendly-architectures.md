# DDD friendly architectures

Most of the discussion on how to implement DDD implicitly presumes the view of a "traditional" JEE web application having a three-tier architecture - web client, app (UI layer, business layer, data access layer), and an RDBMS.

Other interesting architectural patterns to look into:
- [Model-centric architecture](http://spif.sourceforge.net/modelcentric.html)
- [Composite Oriented Programming](http://www.infoq.com/articles/Composite<sub>~Programming</sub>~Qi4j)
- [Naked objects](http://www.nakedobjects.org)
