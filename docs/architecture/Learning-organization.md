#### Why is it important to build a learning organization?

- Create a common respect for your co-workers strengths.
- Be humble for the fact that the team can achieve more than the sum of each team members effort.
- Reduce the unwanted effect of co-workers putting their personal goals before the goals of the project.
- Support the co-workers to help them become better.
- Build a respect for the fact that decisions must be made. Often a single person must make the decision, consensus is a ineffective approach to making decisions.
