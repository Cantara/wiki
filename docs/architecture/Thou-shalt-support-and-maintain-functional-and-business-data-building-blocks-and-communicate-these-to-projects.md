# Thou shalt support and maintain functional and business data building blocks and communicate these to projects

As an organisation architect you have a unique overview over all projects that exist, are in progress, or are on the horizon and how each of these projects relate to each other.

With this overview it is the organisation architect's responsibility to identify cross-project concerns that could potentially become building blocks that can be created for reuse on other projects and to bring existing building blocks to the attention of project architects so that they can evaluate whether their use would be appropriate.
