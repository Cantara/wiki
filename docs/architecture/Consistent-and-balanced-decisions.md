# Consistent and balanced decisions

The main value a great architect provides is when the sum of the decisions keep strengthen each other to create balanced synergies throughout the project, system or organization. Because it is the perception of the receivers that matters here, decisions can only be said to be consistent if the receivers recognize them as consistent. The same can be said about balance; the balance is the trade-offs an architect makes to satisfy the stakeholders.
