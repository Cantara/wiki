# Thou shalt never default to silver bullets or magic

Thou shalt never default to silver bullets or magic, but always ensure that you have several alternatives before making a decision. When making an architectural decision it is important that architects always consider several possible solutions and consider their consequences in the context of the specific task at hand.

- You should never choose a solution based blindly upon the fact that it worked for an earlier problem.
- No single architecture satisfies all possible requirements placed on a particular part of an application.
- Are you using a [square peg for a round hole](http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/square+peg+in+a+round+hole.html)?
- A shiny new large hammer looking for a nail?

- [There is no one-size-fits-all solution](http://97-things.near-time.net/wiki/There%20is%20no%20one-size-fits-all%20solution)

Tip: A rundown of many projects breaking this law, reveals some interesting observations:

- This law is most often broken by architects which has not done much development lately
- This law is most often broken by architects far away from projects
- In almost no examples have the architect breaking this law any extensive hands-on experience in the technology the suggested silver-bullet tries to solve
- Most architects does not admit breaking this law. But if you look at the argumentation for the selection, you will find a very high correlation to myths and sales material.
