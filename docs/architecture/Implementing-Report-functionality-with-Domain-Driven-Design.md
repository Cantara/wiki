# Implementing Report functionality with Domain-Driven Design

Many applications have some forms of report functionality.
This can be all from simple lists on a web page based on aggregated or combined data from multiple sub domains, and to complex generic report analysis typically generated from data warehouses. We'll concentrate the discussion on the more simple requirements which most applications need to implement in one way or another.

How can DDD be used, or combined with other techniques, to produce reports not necessarily well fitted for the underlying domain model ?

Evans, Fowler, and others provide us with some insight in this [discussion](http://www.domaindrivendesign.org/discussion/archive/reporting_from_database.html).
