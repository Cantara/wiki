# Communication vs Technology focus

x % communication & 100-x % technical work 

**TODO**: 

diagram: 

x-axis: communication in percent (one team, multiple teams, organization) 
y-axis: technology / tech work
Put the different roles into the diagram to give a visual feeling for how the relate to each other. 

PS: A VENN-diagram is worthless, since the roles overlap too much and are too imprecisely defined.
