# Principles for data collection in a sensor network

###### Context 

Hardware sensors/devices produce some sort of data. Since the data is automatically generated, the data volume is non-trivial. Several consumers are interested in this data. 
As the number of devices grow and the amount of data they send (and how often), the need for a scalable system arises. 

No system or context is identical, but there are many decisions to make and experience matters. This is an attempt to capture some lessons learned when building this type of system.
