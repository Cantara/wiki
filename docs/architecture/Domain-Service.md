"A SERVICE is an operation offered as an interface that stands alone in the model, without encapsulating state, as ENTITIES and VALUE OBJECTS do." [smidigtonull:Evans 2003]

See [this blog](http://stochastyk.blogspot.com/2008/05/domain-services-in-domain-driven-design.html) for some good advice on implementing Domain Services.
