# Code repository

We are using Github as a repository for our code. Everyone has read access. The main HTML is located in dashboard.html, and the scripts of interest are located in the scripts<sub>~folder. See [http://github.com/ivarconr/html5</sub>~codecamp](http://github.com/ivarconr/html5-codecamp) for these files.

# Implementation

We have built a single<sub>~page HTML5</sub>~based web page that does not require any plugins to render. We have focused on the following technologies.

- HTML5 declarative form validation
- HTML5 canvas logo together with the new canvas javascript APIs
- Canvas and javascript for viewing images in a slideshow with overlay blending
- Local storage using the new WebSQL APIs (blog posts are stored locally)
- New CSS3 properties are utilized
- Websockets implementation using hosted Hookbox to publish new blog posts. 
- Using a rich text editor powered by pure javascript
- Web fonts for header text

The following is a list of possible improvements, patches are welcome

- Additional storage of blog posts on a server
- Authentication
- Adding comments to blog posts
