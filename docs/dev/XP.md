# XP

# eXtreme Programming (XP)

_An early methodology to gather mainstream popularity._

## Practices

It defines a number of practices that are pretty common in most agile projects. Some examples:

- Pair-programmering
- Unit-testing
- Continous Integration
- The 10-minute build
- Weekly meetings
- Shrinking teams

## Oslo XP Meetup

As this wiki is hosted in Oslo, it would be a shame not to mention the popular XP Meetup: http://xp.meetup.com/13/

The XP meetup isn't particularly about XP the methodology. It's more about [Agile](Agile.md) in general. But the old name just kind of stuck.
