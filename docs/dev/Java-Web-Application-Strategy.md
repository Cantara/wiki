# Java Web Application Strategy

This web application strategy is a collection of tactics, architecture and patterns and a few other good practices. The goal is to provide an starting point for projects within the defined scope and try to make the recommendations as easy to adopt as possible. 

### Scope 

We have chosen to limit the scope of this strategy as follows:

- Java Web Applications, the servlet-based kind (something with a web.xml)
- Request/Response oriented web frameworks like Struts2 and SpringMVC (they are widely used, and we know them well)
- An enterprise context (we know it's a sketchy definition, but the solution will have to be cost-effective over a long period, and probably have to comply with a bunch of infrastructure standards, etc.)

### Components in the strategy

- [Enterprise Maven Infrastructure](Enterprise<sub>~Maven</sub>~Infrastructure.md) 
- [Web Application JigZaw](Web<sub>~Application</sub>~JigZaw.md)
- [Web Application Architecture](Web<sub>~Application</sub>~Architecture.md)
- [Web application container pull deployment](Web<sub>~application</sub><sub>container</sub><sub>pull</sub>~deployment.md)
- [Web Application Security](Web<sub>~Application</sub>~Security.md)
- [Web Application Logging](Web<sub>~Application</sub>~Logging.md)
- [Agile Mindset and Methodology](Agile<sub>~Mindset</sub>~and-Methodology.md)
