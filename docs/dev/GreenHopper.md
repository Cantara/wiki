# GreenHopper

- The [GreenHopper plugin](http://www.atlassian.com/software/greenhopper/overview) may be useful for sprint follow-up, planning and reporting. Note that while Jira + GreenHopper is a better match for agile development than Jira alone, it is not a perfect fit. 

- TODO: Investigate GreenHopper support for release (not sprint) burn down charts 
    - [Release Burndown Charts - Agile Scrum Release](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrum/release-burndown) and [Alternative Scrum Release Burndown Chart](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrum/alt-releaseburndown)

- The [Planning Board](http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/GH/Using+the+Planning+Board) helps you schedule many issues over an entire release cycle. 

- The [Task Board](http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/GH/Using+the+Task+Board) to show you the work-queue for a version or component. 
    - [Training for Scrum Task Board Use](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrum/task-boards)

- The [Chart Board](http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/GH/Using+the+Chart+Board) which will show you the burn-down chart for a sprint. The chart board offers the following graphs:
