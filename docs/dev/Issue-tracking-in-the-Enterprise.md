# Issue tracking in the Enterprise

### Release notes 

How to automate release notes? 
When to force all changes through an issue tracker and when to write a custom overview? 

### Selection criteria 

What properties must the issue tracker we choose have? 
Is Jira the only product which satisfies our needs? 

### Structure 

Jira specific structure recommendations

Project vs component 

Couplings between versions in jira, versioning scheme, releases 

Traceability

Different people have different views and needs: Project management, test (FAT), developers 

### Automation and tool support 

Agile methodologies encourage frequent deployments. Frequent deployments means frequent releases, which in turn means that standardization and automation is necessary. The software used for release notes must therefore integrate closely with the tool used to automate the release process.
