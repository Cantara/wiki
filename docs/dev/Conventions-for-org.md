### The IaM Security paradox

> 📝 * _Most_ companies define the HR system as the IaM **master source**
> 📝 * _Most_ companies **outsource** the HR system and many HR functions
> 📝 * **the IaM master is outside the company's control**...

### Some reflections

- HR system is master for users, roles per user/group. 
- Delegate assignment of roles to users to the HR manager of each department/group. 
- They use contract/relation as filter/grouping, not "employee". E.g. part time employees (temps), partners, contractors, etc. 
    - Many, many user repositories. 
    - Cannot enforce roles across applications. Doesn't scale. Need to accept that each application has its own set of roles. 
- **The _meaning_ of roles is defined in each application.**
