# JigZaw Design Principles and Drivers

The foundation for JigZaw is the core principles and drivers. The key concepts are: 

- [Maximize value of testing](Maximize-value-of-testing.md)
- [Verify expected behavior instead of looking for bugs](Verify-expected-behavior-instead-of-looking-for-bugs.md)

- [Divide and conquer](Divide-and-conquer.md)
- [Multidimensional Test Categorization](JigZaw-Multidimensional-Test-Categorization.md)

- [Timeline](Timeline.md)

The concepts should be abstract and technology independent. Guides to implementation and howtos for concrete problems can be found in the [Tools and implementation](Tools-and-implementation.md) section.
