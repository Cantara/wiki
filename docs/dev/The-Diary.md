# The Diary

*Write and share a few notes on what you do each day.*

Allow your team to write their daily doings on a wiki, one page for each team member. Here's an example page:

> ### 22nd of October 2008
>
> #### Worked on the login (issue 3508)
>
> - Got some help from Jim
> - Some certificate issues. We solved and documented the problem on this wiki page.
>
> #### Spend the rest of the day performance tuning the User table queries
>
> Tried this caching product, but didn't work out. Will get help tomorrow.
>
> ### 21st of October 2008
>
> #### Monitored the log files
>
> Looks good, but one new error. Sent it to the team for feedback. Created issue 3557 (link).
>
> #### Set up CI on our project
>
> Was easy. Just added a Plan in Bamboo, worked quite easily.

## Some key advantages of having diaries

- People stay focused on doing what they should do
- People remember much better what to say at the [Daily Standup meeting](/web/20220817064658/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/Daily+Standup+meeting "Daily Standup meeting")
- More transparency on what the team is doing.
- The old diary often comes in handy when searching for old problems.
