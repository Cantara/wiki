# Pragmatic Programming

_Agile does not mean idealistic or dogmatic._

It can be argued whether the term pragmatic is a useful one. If we say pragmatism is the doctrine that practical consequences are the criteria of knowledge and meaning and value (google result), then pragmatism is synonymous to agile.

Nonetheless, pragmatic is in the title of a book that all programmers should read in the pursuit of being more agile: [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/)

It stays clear of most alternative lingos for agile, but still touches in on the most important values of agile. A good read for novice programmers and experienced developers unfamiliar with agile.
