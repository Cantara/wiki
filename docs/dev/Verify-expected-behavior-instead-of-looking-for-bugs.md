# Verify expected behavior instead of looking for bugs

Traditional testing is aimed at **finding bugs**, where a bug is defined as a mismatch between the specification and the actual behavior of the software under test. 

**JigZaw aims at making sure the system works as expected.** 

The difference may seem subtle, but there is a difference between **_the specification_** and **_works as expected_**. _Works as expected_ is not one, precise definition. Instead it refers to the different views we can have on a system and that each test should focus on a single aspect. Works as expected has thus a very strong focus on regression-testing.

In other words, **ensuring that functionality works is more important than finding deviations from a specification**.
