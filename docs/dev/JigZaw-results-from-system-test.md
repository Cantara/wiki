# JigZaw results from system test

The following information should be persisted for each system test: 

- Timestamp start of test 
- Timestamp end of test 

- Metrics from the test 
    - quantitative 

- Which applications? 

- For each application 
    - what version? 
    - what configuration? 
    - which data? 
 

- Base system
    - Hardware description for each node
    - Software description (jdk version, encoding, 32/64 bit, architecture)

These data can then be used as basis for automatic generation of 

- reports 
- graphs (e.g. see how the performance changes over time) 
- BI
