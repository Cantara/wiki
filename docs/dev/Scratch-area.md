Secondary benefits: 

- More content and more consistent content in the Agile 2.0 wiki space
- A list of unsolved "pains" that we should know how to solve 
- Code examples/patches to ease some known pains. 

#### Some starting questions

- Deployment and packing 
    - Create Maven-archetype? (**programming**)

- Maintenance 
    - What problems usually cause problems later on? 
    - Can these be prevented with simple/cheap means? 
    - Code monsters? 
        - There has recently been created a maven-plugin which checks for new versions of the dependencies in a project. Perhaps this is worth looking at as a means to detecting possible library update candidates?
