| Introduction **Mission statement**  The purpose of this wiki is to create processes, techniques and technology which, in combination, will provide cost efficient and easy-to-adopt bootstrapping environments. The starting point is agile methodology, but the focus is to solve the challenges in the enterprise under realistic conditions. By this we mean extending/strengthen the [agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) with:   - evolve ability and **maintainability** over project heroes - sustainability and total customer **value** over features and glass bowl project focus - facts and **knowledge** over religion and preaching  **Where to begin**  Even if your project do not fall into the sustainable or enterprise category, there should be **plenty of valuable advice** here which will prove useful. Our featured articles below provide some starting points, or you can search for topics.   |  | | --- | | Page: [JaMaCU Deployment Strategy](/web/20211128143935/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/JaMaCU+Deployment+Strategy) | | Page: [Maven Infrastructure](/web/20211128143935/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/Maven+Infrastructure) | | Page: [JigZaw](/web/20211128143935/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/JigZaw) | | Page: [Agile Mindset and Methodology](/web/20211128143935/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/Agile+Mindset+and+Methodology) |   Searching KM: Software Development | Main components  - [Agile and Software Architecture](/web/20211128143935/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/architecture/Agile+and+Software+Architecture "Agile and Software Architecture") - [Agile Mindset and Methodology](/web/20211128143935/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/Agile+Mindset+and+Methodology "Agile Mindset and Methodology") - [Strategies](/web/20211128143935/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/Strategies "Strategies") - [Tactics](/web/20211128143935/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/Tactics "Tactics")  Popular Pieces  - [JigZaw](/web/20211128143935/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/JigZaw "JigZaw") - [Maven Infrastructure](/web/20211128143935/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/Maven+Infrastructure "Maven Infrastructure") - [Installation and Deployment Automation](/web/20211128143935/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/Installation+and+Deployment+Automation "Installation and Deployment Automation") - [Maven FAQ](/web/20211128143935/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/Maven+FAQ "Maven FAQ") - [Test Frameworks and Tools](/web/20211128143935/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/Test+Frameworks+and+Tools "Test Frameworks and Tools") - [Lightweight alternatives to heavyweight technologies](/web/20211128143935/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/Lightweight+alternatives+to+heavyweight+technologies "Lightweight alternatives to heavyweight technologies")  Resources  - [Presentation repository](/web/20211128143935/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/Presentations+and+Publications "Presentations and Publications") - [Glossary](/web/20211128143935/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/Glossary "Glossary") |
