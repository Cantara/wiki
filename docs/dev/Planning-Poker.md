# Planning Poker

*Do you plan poker?*

Planning poker is a session where the team gets together and puts some estimates on the backlog. The goal is to rip out hidden complexity (one team member may know details that make some backlog items extra complex), creates discussion and a common commitment in the team.

Estimates are hopefully made using [Gummy Bears](/web/20210122151100/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/Gummy+Bears "Gummy Bears").
