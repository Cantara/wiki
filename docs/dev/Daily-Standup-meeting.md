# Daily Standup meeting

_The daily get-together ceremony._

In [Scrum](Scrum.md), this is called "the daily Scrum". The point is to gather the team together for a short (10 minutes or less) face-to-face meeting, standing up.

Normally, the team makes a round where each team member presents the following:

1. What they worked on yesterday
1. What they are going to do today
1. Any impediments they may have

At the same time, updates are made to task-boards, [Backlog](Backlog.md), etc.

As well as keeping the team members in sync on what the rest are doing, it is also a great opportunity to radiate impediments upwards to the team manager or scrum master.
