# Agile Organizations

Agile organizations measure and reward software development that returns long-term value and cost-efficiency.

### Good signs

- An infrastructure that doesn't make people shave yaks
- Software transparency in their infrastructure, like:
    - Wiki
    - [Enterprise Maven Infrastructure](Enterprise-Maven-Infrastructure.md)
    - Code inspection (FishEye)
    - Continous integration
- Lots of whiteboards around
- Lots of utility rooms
- The ability to move between open landscape and peaceful offices by need
- Focus on fun
    - You have a XBox/Fussball/Pool room, and employees are not afraid to use it!
- Free coffee/soda/fruit
- Slack time for doing nerdy stuff
- IT department honors [The Programmer's Bill of Rights](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000666.html)
- ...

### Bad signs

- Deep hierarchies
- Lots of inter-project dependencies
- Heavy formal workflows and processes
- Hard to find out who does what
- Hard to get hold of good hardware (24" screens, multi-core cpu, etc)
- Firewall blocks social web sites, webmail, etc
- ...
