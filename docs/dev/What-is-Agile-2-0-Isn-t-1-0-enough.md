# What is Agile 2.0? Isn't 1.0 enough?

First draft

You can learn agile development by reading a lot of books on the subject. And basic understanding of Scrum and XP concepts is IMHO necessary to work agilely. However, necessary is not the same as sufficient. **Experience** is needed to work _efficiently_ with any methodology. So if basic agile development is 1.0, then basic agile + lessons learned can be termed Agile 2.0. 

One of these lessons learned is that a methodology must be applied in a context. And in this context agile development must relate to architecture, system complexity (e.g. distributed systems are often much more complex than a single standalone application.), DDD, TDD, BDD, OW test model/V-model, Maven, CI, +++

In other words, if a project team wants to successfully apply agile development methodologies, it is necessary to apply the agile mindset to the rest of the components related to development process. 

###### Example: agile solution to documentation

- Maven - technical site
- Wiki - for day to day project documentation
    - Wiki as single-point-of-entry for all project members. 
    - Export from wiki serves as the documentation deliverable. 

Benefits: 

- Reduce the amount of documents 
- Transition from static to dynamic documentation 
- A practical implementation of working software over documentation, i.e., let's make documentation as little hassle as possible.
