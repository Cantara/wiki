# How to bridge the gap between Operations and Development

Needs cleanup

aka. the gap between agile and ITIL

### Problem description 

What hurts? 
What problems to we need to address? 

- Hard to get resources from Operations early in the project 
- Hard to get Operations as official stakeholders (and thus someone who can write user stories) 
- 

### Which problems are "solved" already (just not well-known)? 

Erik thinks that many of the problems we discussed at Smidig2008 can be solved by atomizing the process of creating deployment artifacts from jar files. E.g. from jar file to RPM as explained in [RPM Deployment with Java Service Wrapper](RPM-Deployment-with-Java-Service-Wrapper.md). 

### Brainstorming / "core brain dump" 

The "_solution_" is of course to try to achieve competence overlap. Teach sysadmins basic developer skills and teach developers basic sysadmin skills. 

**SIMPLICITY**: The need for training can be minimized if the deployment procedure is simple. IMHO the following procedure should suffice: 

1. Download deployment package 
1. Install deployment package 
1. Read installation manual to understand how to tweak and configure the application
