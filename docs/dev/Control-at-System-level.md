# Control at System level

To achieve control at the system level is much harder than control at the application level. Unlike the application level, the system level cannot be specified completely. The reason is that control at the system level is all about _trust_ and _confidence_. How much control do _you_ need to feel safe enough to allow automated deployment and upgrades? We don't know, but we can give you the toolbox you need to get there. 

- Automated system tests
