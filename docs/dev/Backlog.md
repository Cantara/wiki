# Backlog

_The agile todo-list._

The backlog should be a pretty familiar concept to most agile practioneers. Although it most commenly used in [Scrum](Scrum.md), all methods have some notation of a backlog. The product backlog is simply the team's todo-list. Some teams prefer to eliminate backlogs in favor of [Kanban](Kanban.md).

### Typical traits of the backlog

- Each item on the backlog is expressed in a [user story](User-Stories.md), or other simple requirement terms.
- The order of priority are the items are top<sub>~first, bottom</sub>~last.
- Priority is maintained by the Product Owner. Sometimes also **business points** are set on each task.
- **The team** is responsible for estimating each item's complexity (not using hours, but [Gummy Bears](Gummy-Bears.md)).
- Each item consists of several **tasks** that can have an attribute of "hours remaining". This if for producing the burndown-chart.
- Each Sprint planning eats a manageble number of items off the backlog and assigns them to the sprint.

### Weaknesses of the backlog

- It usually builds up a long tail of items that are never done.
- It is often misunderstood to be a place for technical tasks as well, but items that focus on quality tend to be pushed down by the business side.
- Backlogs are not nurtured as much as they should be, meaning estimates are not remade, duplicate tasks are not removed, etc.
- It can be hard to integrate the backlog with existing project management toolkits (GANNT charts, etc)
- Priority can loose its connection to value. It's important for the product owner to define values and measure these (see [EVO](EVO.md)), and maintain priorities accordingly.
