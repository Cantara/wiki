# JigZaw TODO

#### Challenges 

###### Mapping between requirements and tests. 

- The mapping between requirements and tests can be made using the group concept in testng for testng<sub>~based tests. However, the test report generated with maven</sub><sub>surefire</sub><sub>plugin doesn't include this information. See [SUREFIRE</sub>~472: Add support for view by groups in the surefire report](http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/SUREFIRE-472). 

- How to create a single report for different types of tests? 
    - A manually maintained Table of Contents which links to the test reports from the different tools seems like the most pragmatic approach. A wiki or a test management tool like HP QualityCenter can probably be used to maintain the links.

#### TODOs 

- Merge [JigZaw Test Levels](JigZaw<sub>~Test</sub><sub>Levels.md) and [JigZaw Categorization Matrix](JigZaw</sub><sub>Categorization</sub>~Matrix.md). 
- Create a figure illustrating the different test levels. 
- Update diagram illustrating the aspects of the different test types. 
- Update [Test structure](Test-structure.md)
