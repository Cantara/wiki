## Other thoughts/methodologies we have sampled concepts from

These are presentations from thought leaders on testing

- [James Coplien, Javazone 2007, Five practical solutions to agile myths](http://www4.java.no/javazone/2007/show.do%3Fpage=92&articleid=5397.1.html) - good because it deals with stuff in TDD that doesn't work, or which Coplien doesn't think makes sense
- [Mary Poppendieck, Agile 2007, The role of leadership in software development](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/poppendieck-agile-leadership) - good because it deals with quality processes, not just testing

- [Behaviour Driven Design (BDD), Dan North](http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd) [http://behaviour-driven.org](http://behaviour-driven.org/)
