# CouchDB Simple hosted JSON DB for mobile and js apps

#### CouchDB Simple hosted JSON/REST DB for mobile/.js apps
[http://cloudant.com](http://cloudant.com) offers free hosting of CouchDB instances which are trivial to get started with and provides a decent REST interface from which one can replace with other technology later without eating too many camels.
Pros:
- Quick setup for JSON/HTTP DB POC's
- REST - JSON/HTTP
- Nice admin web-GUI
- [Good documentation](https://cloudant.com/for<sub>~developers/crud/#curl</sub>~update)
- Much easier setting up and using from client side than MongoDB
- Bundles Lucene for search in documents
- Easy tutorial for setting up nice url's for accessing json documents [here](http://blog.pasker.net/2013/02/13/how<sub>~to</sub><sub>setup</sub><sub>a</sub><sub>vhost</sub><sub>for</sub><sub>a</sub><sub>couchdb</sub>~couchapp/) [Example of my usage](http://heap.kompo.st/JavaZone_Demo)

Cons:

- You'll probably use a different setup/tech stack in later iterations
