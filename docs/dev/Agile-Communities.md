# Agile Communities

Agile communities/industries celebrate and recognize organizations and individuals that provide more value.

### Good signs:

- Annual conferences on topics of software development
- Weekly meetups (No fluff, just stuff kind of things)
- Alot of interchanging knowledge between corporations
- ...

### Bad signs:

- You don't even know if your town has any community :)
