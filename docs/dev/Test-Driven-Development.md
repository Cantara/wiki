# Test-Driven Development

*The ever more popular test-first approach.*

A widely popular programming rythm where you write failing tests before implementing/changing the functionality of functional code.

### Rules

(as roughly gathered from [Uncle Bob](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd))

1. Never write production code unless it is to make a failing test pass.
2. Never write more tests than necessary to get one failing test.
3. Only refactor when all tests are passing.

Some people (like [Jim Coplient at JavaZone 2007](http://www4.java.no/javazone/2007/show.do%3Fpage=92&articleid=5397.1.html)) have observed that TDD has a detoriating effect on software. This notion is challenged by Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin and there is [a debate between them available on InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/interviews/coplien-martin-tdd) portraying this.

There are many good pointers on this wiki on how to avoid the pitfalls of TDD. See [Test](/web/20201124143213/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/Test "Test") and [JigZaw](/web/20201124143213/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/JigZaw "JigZaw") in particular.

### TDD as if you meant it

A TDD style which emphasizes writing production code within the test before gradually moving it out as needed.
