# System Release Standardization

#### Introduction 

There are basically two approaches to releasing a system: 

1. Release all components and their corresponding documentation individually. _Component_ _release_ for short.
1. Release all components and the documentation for the system as one unit. _System_ _release_ for short.

Each has its advantages and disadvantages and there are much to consider before deciding. One of the first decisions is the _**format**_ of the [Documentation Release](Documentation-Release.md) and tool support for software release.
