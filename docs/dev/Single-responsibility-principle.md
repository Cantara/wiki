# Single-responsibility principle

[Single-responsibility principle (SRP)](http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/srp.pdf): A test should have only one reason to change. Test code (as well as regular code) is then easier to refactor and easier to maintain. These attributes are by themselves enticing. Further, tests should be structured in such a way that if one test fails you know exactly where the problem is. This simplifies debugging, since the error message produced by the failed test explains what failed in a precise manner.
