# Commit Notification

_Automatically announce new code._

One of the most powerful practices compared to how easy it is to set up, is commit mails. It is a built<sub>~in feature in most SCM</sub>~systems. Notifications are usually delivered via mail, but it is also possible to support channels like RSS, Jabber, IRC and others.

Commit notifications are like distributed miniature code<sub>~reviews. With every commit, a notification is sent out to all developers with an overview of the commit</sub>~message, revision number, and code added/removed in the commit. This gives every developer the chance to keep an eye on what code goes in and out of the project.

See http://wiki.community.objectware.no/display/sysadm/Version+Control+System+tips+and+tricks for some ideas for concrete implementation.
