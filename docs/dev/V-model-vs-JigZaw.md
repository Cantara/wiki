# V-model vs JigZaw

The purpose of this page is to provide a comparison between the [V-Model (Wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Model_%28software_development%29) and [JigZaw](JigZaw.md). The goal is to illustrate the logical differences between the two models. 

| V-Model | JigZaw |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Waterfall model | Agile development, Continuous deployment/production |
| Strict test phases and test categorization | Multiple aspects are tested in every iteration/[sprint | http://scrummethodology.com/scrum-sprint/] |  |
| Built-in overlap between tests | Aims to minimize the overlap between tests |  |
| One tool (set) per test category | Tools are chosen to match the problem at hand(many different tools) |  |
| Guides the practitioner to understand and attack the problem | Provides highly efficient tools and techniques for skilled practitioners to maximize their testing effort |  |
