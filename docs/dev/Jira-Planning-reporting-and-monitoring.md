# Jira Planning, reporting and monitoring

#### Principles
- The [Product owner](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrum/product-owner) owns the Jira project(s) and is responsible for maintaining a healthy [product backlog](Backlog.md). 

- A developer should (ideally) be dedicated to one team (and thus a single sprint).
