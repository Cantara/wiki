### What is Agile?

_A description of agile in general._

In our words, agile is a culture on many levels that allows change for the better, meaning more value as it is specified the manifesto.

- At the [community level](Agile-Communities.md), our industry celebrates and recognizes organizations and individuals that provide more value.
- At the [organizational level](Agile<sub>~Organizations.md), we (as leaders) measure and reward software development that returns long</sub>~term value and cost-efficiency.
- At the [individual level](Agile<sub>~Individuals.md), we (as developers) keep our work transparent and take pride in our craftmanship. We remain loyal to our [Programming Ethics](Programming</sub>~Ethics.md) and strive to work more efficiently.

It is no easy task to boil agile down to one sentence, but here are some attempts and paraphrases.

"Do a good job." (Uncle Bob)

"Inspect and adapt." (Mike Cohn)

"Be as productive as possible in producing customer value" (Totto)

"I am not agile. I get **more** agile." (from a Norwegian entry in [Johannes' blog](http://brodwall.com/johannes/blog/2008/04/14/smidigere/))

**And as always, [The Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) and [The Principles behind it](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html).**
