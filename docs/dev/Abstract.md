# Abstract

Do you want to simpelfy the writing of tests? Do you want to make testing easier?
Ever avoided writing tests because the tests were too hard to write? 
In this presentation we will show you how to test write, simple, easy<sub>~to</sub>~write and evolvable tests,  for applcations that has been «untestable».

OW Test Model is a set of guidelines on how to design maintainable tests for complex business scenarios. An important driver in OW Test Model is avoiding the big, all-encompassing tests. Small, concise tests with a single reponsibility are easier to write, easier to maintain and better in targeting the functionallity the code is supposed to deliver.

The presentation will focus on how you can structure and categorize system- and integration<sub>~tests when the number of dimensions grow. Dimensions like data</sub>~driven test, performancetesting, tests that require a JMS server, tests that cover web services or tests that need an special container.
We will present a strategy for addressing these challenges and show how they can be implemented with freely available Open Source Software. 

The principles of Domain<sub>~Driven Design, and Service Oriented Design are a major contributors  in OW Test Model. We will show you how these principles, as well as best practices from Object</sub>~Oriented Design can be applied to your testing, and what valued they give.

Keywords: DDD, TDD, Single<sub>~Responsibility</sub>~Principle, Continuous Integration Server, Maven, Maven artifact repository and TestNG. 

Final note: OW Test Model has proven its right to exist, in real complex real-world projects. Of course we will share experiences from these projects with you.

Key take-aways:
A new way thinking of testing.
Recommendation of how you can put this model into action.
Real-world examples from complex projects.

«May the force be with you, make the tests work for YOU»
