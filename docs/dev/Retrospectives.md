# Retrospectives

*The post-iteration meeting where the team seeks improvement.*

### Try/Stop/Keep

Reserve at least an hour for this meeting (depending on length of iteration). All team members are encouraged to suggest changes to the current set of [Practices](/web/20220817075623/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/dev/Practices "Practices") employed by the team. The changes are categorized like this onto a white-board:

- Try: Any practices that the team would like to try out in the next iteration
- Keep: Any practices attempted in the previous iteration that the team would like to keep on doing
- Stop: Any practices attempted in the previous iteration that the teal would like to get rid off

### Resources

There really aren't so many good resources and definitions on retrospectives... Feel free to add more.

I found a very good example of a Scrum master's experience from his first retrospective here: <http://pragmaticintegration.blogspot.com/2007/01/first-scrum-sprint-retrospective.html>
