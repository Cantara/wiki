# About failing agile projects

![http://globalnerdy.com/wordpress/wp<sub>~content/uploads/2007/11/dilbert</sub><sub>agile_programming.gif](http://globalnerdy.com/wordpress/wp</sub><sub>content/uploads/2007/11/dilbert</sub><sub>agile_programming.gif)(http://globalnerdy.com/wordpress/wp</sub><sub>content/uploads/2007/11/dilbert</sub>~agile_programming.gif)

There's a trend in the blogosphere showing an increasing number/percentage of agile projects failing. We believe that the reason for this is quite simply that many projects are attempting to use agile methods. 

Some of these can be expected to fail, either because _(a)_ the method is abused or misunderstood, or _(b)_ the project was doomed to fail anyway.

In theory, agile methodology is not to blame for the failing of agile projects. Projects fail _(b)_, but an agile project will fail sooner than later, and cost less than a long death-march project.

We wish to ensure that fewer projects fail for reason _(a)_. By [extending the agile manifesto](Agile<sub>~Software</sub>~Development-Home.md), and by documenting [Agile](Agile.md) in this wiki, we are doing what we can to turn the tide of failing agile projects.
