# Requirement tests vs code tests

Bjørn Bjerkli has written an interesting blog post with the title "Testing code or testing requirements". Unfortunately, the hyperlink doesn't seem to work properly, so we have to link to the [comment page](https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=29135008&postID=318550958564733407) (where Johannes has an interesting reply).

The post provides a good background for our needs:

- We want to be able to express our requirement tests freely, with any kind of techonlogy, be it FIT, Java, RSpec, etc.
- We want to communicate our requirement tests with business people well.

So far, it seems like BDD reports and FITnesse are the only viable solutions with a real focus on communicating requirement tests with the customer. Any other ideas?
