# Agile Individuals

Agile developers keep their work transparent and take pride in their craftmanship. They remain loyal to their [Programming Ethics](Programming-Ethics.md) and strive to work more efficiently.

When it comes to it, this level of agile is what it's all about. Most of the litterature focuses on the individual level, so we won't dwelve deeply into this now. Instead, head back to [Agile](Agile.md) and read on from there.
