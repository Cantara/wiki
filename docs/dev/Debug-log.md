# Debug log

Debug logging is a tool for software developers to determine the cause of an error. 

- Should never be enabled by default in production environments. 

- Verbose - as much context as possible (e.g. stack traces) 

- Technical - does not need to be user friendly 

- Must contain a reference to the code in question (e.g. Class and line number) 

- Can contain tracing information to help determine the flow through the system.
