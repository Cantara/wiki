# The new semantic elements (section, article, nav etc..).

There are currently no attachments on this page.

### Basics

```
<!doctype html>
<html lang=en>
<meta chartype=utf-8>
<title>Hello Oslo</title>
<p>Yo!
</html>
```

**Points**

- [http://html5.validator.no](http://html5.validator.no/) HTML5 validator
- Without <body> tag, IE won't style (render CSS) (Not needed in spec, IE bug)
- <http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/>

### header, footer, article, nav, {display:block;}

```

```

**Points**

- <small> are redefined in HTML5, its intended for "small print" like copyright notices etc. Not small as in visual small
- Yahoo have analyzed visitors and found that only 1% surf with JavaScript off.
