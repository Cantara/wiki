# Program detailed - Draft 01

Hi everybody

Here is a more detailed description of the program we want to run trough at the HTML5 camp. Bruce; you have got a big part of this earlier so maybe a bit of a repeat for you. I will try to cut it short.

You are all encouraged to comment on the topics, ideas and off cause add ideas to what we can do. But, no need to if you do not have the time or feel comfortable with the plan already

Our intention during the weekend is to part by part build a true web application. The application we have in mind is a "blog admin / input" interface. The reason for selecting this as the topic is because it raises a field where a lot of the new parts in HTML5 solves old problems we have been struggling with for a long time. One example is for instence the possibility to store larger amount of data client side. In a blog input interface a browser crash can cause loss of what an author might have been writing in a blog input interface if he / she has not saved server side during writing. With client side storage we are now able to build web applications which can help us store typed input during writing and thereby be able to restore the data in case of a crash. Built in form validation will also save us a lot of the JavaScript pain we now are using to do input validation on the client. The list of benefits are long!

We want to have short introductions to each topic we want to run trough. Then each group (5 persons in each group) will go and add a new piece to the application based on what they have been presented.

Our idea are to build up the application in this order:

1 - Talk - An overview of what we developers struggle with today   
and how HTML5 can solve parts of those.  
2 - Talk - A brief history lesion on why we have got HTML5.  
3 - Talk - The new semantic elements (section, article, nav etc..).  
4 - Coding - Build a framework for the application with the new semantic   
elements.  
5 - Talk - The new form elements, attributes and input validation.  
6 - Coding - Append input elements with input validation to the application.  
7 - Talk - Web Storage  
8 - Coding - Append a feature which stores the content in each input   
field in a Web Storage on each keystroke to prevent data loss.  
9 - Talk - Web SQL  
10 - Coding - Append a feature where the user can store and reopen written   
content.  
11 - Talk - Canvas  
12 - Talk - The Drag and Drop API  
13 - Coding - Append a feature where the user can drag an image from the   
desktop into the application. Add a feature where canvas   
are used to view the image (can include features to manipulate   
the image and display the manipulated version in a canvas.   
A third party library can be used for the manipulation).  
14 - Talk - Video and Audio  
15 - Coding - Add video and audio support to the upload feature with a preview.  
16 - Talk - W3C Widgets  
17 - Coding - Wrap the Web Application we have created into a W3C Widget for   
distribution.  
18 - Talk - How can we start to distribute our application today?

The following topics are also topics we want to run trough but these can be dropped if we find the program to be too tight:

19 - Talk - WebSockets  
20 - Coding - Add support for live editing among two blog input interfaces   
(require that we provide a server with websockets which can act   
as a proxy).  
21 - Talk - Online / offline detection  
22 - Coding - Add support for online / offline detection. If offline prompt   
user and start to store client side.

We would also like to touch the topic of HTML5 and mobile but that might be to press too much into the weekend. Do note that this program is approximately spread out over 3 days. Point 1 will be on Friday as a warm up. Saturday can hold point 2 until point 15. Point 16 until 22 (++ if time) on Sunday.

What do you think guys? Anything we are missing out on? Something we should leave out or exchange with something else?

When it comes to who takes on what, it is already some parts which can be divided among us. Bruce are a real killer at all the markup stuff but, according to himself, not that hardcore on the JS stuff. I or Gregers will also hold a couple of talks.

I suggest the following:  
Bruce holds: 2, 3, 5 and perhaps 14...  
Me / Gregers holds: 1, 16 and 18. I can also participate in 19.

Dylan / Robert; what do you feel comfortable taking on?

This mail is also stored in the Cantara wiki:   
Does mail conversation suite you best for discussing this or are you guys OK registering in the Cantara wiki and let the discussion run there. If the later, please register, send me your username and I will give you access. NOTE: Everything we put in the Cantara wiki are under a Creative Commons 3.0 license and will be, after some editing and cleaning up, made public after the camp.

A last note; we will also run a small and very "unformal" HTML5 hack competition! We have harvested a pile of Bruce's Introducing HTML5 book as prices to the winning team. We would like you guys to be in the jury for judging the hack's submitted.
