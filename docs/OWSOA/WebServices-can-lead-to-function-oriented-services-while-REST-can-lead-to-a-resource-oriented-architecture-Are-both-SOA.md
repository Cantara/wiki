# WebServices can lead to function oriented services, while REST can lead to a resource oriented architecture. Are both SOA?

Q: WebServices can lead to function oriented services, while REST can lead to a resource oriented architecture. That is, pretty URL as a design heuristic. These are different approaches. Are both SOA?

A: A SOA consists of resources (your data [Aggregated Core Services](ACS.md) and [Core Services](CS.md) - ref [EDR-MDS](EDR-MDS.md)) and functions (executable processes as described in [Human To Application](H2A.md) and [Application to Application](A2A.md) services), so the short answer is yes.
