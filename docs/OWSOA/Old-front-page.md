A complete **end-to-end SOA strategy** to ensure that customers get return on investment (ROI). The result is a **no-nonsense SOA** with clear directions that
• puts **IT and business** on the same path
• ensures the **evolvability** of services
• ensures continuous **creation of business value**
This workspace is committed to improving this strategy.
