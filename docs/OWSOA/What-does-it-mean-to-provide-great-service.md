# What does it mean to "provide great service"?

Q: I find the last statement of the manifest vague. What does it mean to "provide great service"? It is so vague that it doesn't have much value in a service manifest IMHO. 

A: 

**The Service Responsibility**

- REQUIRED: Fulfill the Service Contract
- RECOMMENDED: Fulfill the expectations set to Customers by the Service Description (implicitly or explicitly)
- LEADING: **Surpass the Customers expectations**. 

The service must handle anything that is thrown at him/her

**Service Descriptions**

- Services are described both explicitly and **implicitly**
- Services need to be aware of their implicit responsibility (**customer expectations**) and adapt
- Customers are **trained** through extensive marketing and branding
- **Great service descriptions** and their related contracts are often **adopted** by competitors:
    - (IRL example: McDonalds & Burger King - What's the difference?)

Example: **Evolution of the CustomerService**

- Started out for one client on basic WS-I tech
- Added support for more dialects to attract more consumers (REST etc.)
- Got more clients and implemented a smart cache based on Lucene, supporting more load and more advanced queries
- Responded to client demand delivering sensitive information, but ONLY over a WS-Security enabled channel
- Added Geo-positioning (lat/long) information about customers proactively which created spontaneous applications in the organization
