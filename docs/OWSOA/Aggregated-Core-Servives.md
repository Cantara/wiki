| |  | **Aggregated Core Services** Aggregated Core Services is extensions to [Core Services](/web/20210511171749/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/CS "CS"). ACS is usually either context-specializing (CustomerCustomer and VendorCustomer) or aggregations from several [Core Services](/web/20210511171749/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/CS "CS") like in CustomerDashboard which aggregates from Customer Service, Order Service and possibly more services | |  |
