# SOA security and IAM

How do you relate your SOA to your security strategi (Identity and Access Management, Single Sign On etc.). What is a good IAM-strategy, and how do you implement it?

Keywords:
- SAML 2
- Federation
    - [Distributed IAM checklist](Distributed-IAM-checklist.md)
- Single Sign On
- Open SSO
- ESB or Security proxy

The biggest challenge which IAM implementation faces is that it is **perceived by a lot of business stakeholders to be an IT project**, whereas it is actually a business project because rules are defined across business processes and the organization.
