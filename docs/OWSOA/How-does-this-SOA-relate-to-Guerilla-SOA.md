# How does this SOA relate to Guerilla SOA?

We get this question a lot, and have tried to summon some of the key similarities and differences. The models are **not incompatible**. The main difference is the core focus and values. OW SOA is inward-focusing on how to build great services which are reusable and extensible. [Guerrilla SOA](Guerrilla-SOA.md) is more edge-focused, hitting the container, middleware and protocol areas harder.

| [Guerrilla SOA](Guerrilla-SOA.md) | OW SOA | Equality |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The big fight is the evil ESB vendor lock in | The big fight is to teach developers and architects how to build distributed systems and to care about data and real business value | (x) |
| Protocol centric approach is a good thing | Protocols come and go, lets be protocol agnostic | (x) |
| There will always be spaghetti, let´s be spaghetti friendly | Some things does not change (too much). Let us make sure  that we avoid spaghetti in our Business Objects across our SOA and systems. We can limit the spaghetti to the process services of the edge of our SOA. | (x) |
| Business driven | Business driven | (/) |
| Start small | Start small | (/) |
| Middleware is not key (or necessary) for a SOA | Middleware is not key (or necessary) for a SOA | (/) |
