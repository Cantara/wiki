# Architecture

The software architecture of a program or computing system is the structure or structures of the system, which comprise software components, the externally visible properties of those components, and the relationships between them. The term also refers to documentation of a system's software architecture. Documenting software architecture facilitates communication between stakeholders, documents early decisions about high-level design, and allows reuse of design components and patterns between projects.

|  | **Tottos definition** Software Architecture is the art of making balanced, weighted and consistent technical decisions, which by themselves enhance and enrich each other to a greater whole. |
