| |  | **Mission Statement** A complete **end-to-end SOA strategy** to ensure that customers get return on investment (ROI). The result is a **no-nonsense SOA** with clear directions that:  - puts **IT and business** on the same path - ensures the **evolvability** of services - ensures continuous **creation of business value**   This workspace is committed to improving this strategy. | | |  | **Yes we know..** ..that you are probably bored to death by SOA talks. But there is much to learn to be able to successfully apply a service oriented architecture, and somebody need to speak up and show the way... | | |  | **Terms and definitions** [SOA](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/SOA "SOA") [Real SOA], [Governance](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/Governance "Governance"), [Policy], [Enterprise Architecture (EA)](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/Enterprise+Architecture+%28EA%29 "Enterprise Architecture (EA)"), [PAB](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/PAB "PAB"), [ESE](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/Evolving+Service+Endpoint+Pattern "Evolving Service Endpoint Pattern"), [EDR](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/Enterprise+Domain+Repository+Pattern "Enterprise Domain Repository Pattern")  [Service Manifest](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/Service+Manifest "Service Manifest"), [Service Categories](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/Service+Categories "Service Categories"), [H2A](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/H2A "H2A"), [A2A](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/A2A "A2A"), [ACS](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/ACS "ACS"), [CS](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/CS "CS"),  [Software Design](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/Software+Design "Software Design"), [Architecture](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/Architecture "Architecture"), [Architecture Principles and Axioms](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/Architecture+Principles+and+Axioms "Architecture Principles and Axioms"), [Patterns](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/SOA+Patterns "SOA Patterns"), [IdM](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/Identity+Management+%28IdM%29 "Identity Management (IdM)") , [AM](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/Access+Manager+%28AM%29 "Access Manager (AM)") , [MDM](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/Master+Data+Management+Notes "Master Data Management Notes") | |

|  | Key takeaways  - Business driven - The big fight is to teach developers and architects how to build **distributed systems** and to care about **data** and real **business value** - Some things does not change (too much). Let us make sure that we avoid spaghetti in our Business Objects across our SOA and systems. We can limit the spaghetti to the process services of the edge of our SOA. - Start small - Middleware/ESB is not key (or necessary) for a SOA - [The Laws of SOA](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/The+Laws+of+SOA "The Laws of SOA") - [Design-Time Governance - SOA Design Rules](/web/20101024040557/http://wiki.cantara.no/display/OWSOA/Design-Time+Governance+-+SOA+Design+Rules "Design-Time Governance - SOA Design Rules")  --- |
