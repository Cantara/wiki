# P1. A service shall have one named owner

### Motivation

Ensure that a service is managed and governed sufficiently. An umanaged service can't be relied upon, and will not be successful.

### Argumentation

If you are unable to find an owner for a service, chances are high that the service is unimportant which is not a good metric for success. Also if a service does not have an owner, there is no one to form a service level agreement with, thus no one can give any guarantees about the quality of the service or its service contract. The closer to the business departments you find the owner, the better chances for a successful service.

### Exceptions/spesial cases

In general all services must have an owner, if they are to be included in a SOA-environment.
