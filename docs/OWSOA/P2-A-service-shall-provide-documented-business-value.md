# P2. A service shall provide documented business value

### Motivation

If the service does not provide business value, it will never be of any use/interest

### Discussion

In establishing the business value of a service, we can easily add the Key Performance Indicator for the service, and automatically monitor the generated value against the target values, and thus ensure ownership and mainternance of the services which generates positive values and retire services which is of little value over time.
