# High round-trip cost when developing portlets

Most portlet projects gets caught by non-agile products and technologies and we typically see the round-trip from a change in a portlet until verification (CI or in-container) in the range of 1 to 15 minutes. You should invest in technologies and architecture to keep the round-trip under 15 seconds to ensure an efficient portlet strategy.
