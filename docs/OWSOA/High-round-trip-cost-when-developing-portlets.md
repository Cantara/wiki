# High round-trip cost when developing portlets

Most portlet projects gets caught by non<sub>~agile products and technologies and we typically see the round</sub><sub>trip from a change in a portlet until verification (CI or in</sub><sub>container) in the range of 1 to 15 minutes. You should invest in technologies and architecture to keep the round</sub>~trip under 15 seconds to ensure an efficient portlet strategy.
