# P7. Too generic webparts or portlets shall be avoided

### Motivation

We want our H2A services to be easy to use and to give great service/value.

### Argumentation

Too generic webparts or portlets just moves the complexity to the configuration and shall be avoided. Usually these services are just a very thin presentation layer, which is more easily duplicated than generalized. Too general H2A services actually cost more to configure than it cost to duplicate.
