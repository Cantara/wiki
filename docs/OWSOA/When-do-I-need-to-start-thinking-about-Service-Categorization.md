# When do I need to start thinking about Service Categorization?

Quick answer: If you are going the SOA route as an important system strategy, you need to start thinking about what a service is, how they relate to each other and how they differ and make great building blocks for use/reuse - hence Service categorization. If you are writing a (silo) application, which only consumes a few WebServices, you are home free, not bothering with service categorization.

Key takeaways:

- You easily learn that you do have different types of services
- Each category of services have their own requirements to technical infrastructure
- Each category of services have their own design rules (governance)
- To build a SOA, you need to have a precise definition of what a service is which is meaningful.
