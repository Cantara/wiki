# SurrogateMaster

The [SurrogateMaster](SurrogateMaster.md) term describes the role a [Core Service](Core-Service.md) takes when it starts coordinating, mapping and synchronizing its datasources. By taking this responsibility the "Master discussion" is terminated through the service handling this to the best of its ability.
