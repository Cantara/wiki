# Are there alternatives to this SOA Service Categorization? Which?

Both IBM and Microsoft have some up with somewhat similar service categorizations. The similarities are quite striking and might look totally aligned at first glance, but when you dive into the nitty-gritty details you will learn that OW SOA Categorization is the categorization framework which lives closest to the architecture axiom: _Clear and consistant responsibillities powers all great architectures_, whereas the alternatives are more closely aligned to the feature-set in the vendor SOA product platforms.
