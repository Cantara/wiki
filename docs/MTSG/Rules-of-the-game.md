# Rules of the game

### Iteration (5-15 minutes)

- Find a different workstation and pair up with a different partner
- On the sound of the bell swap driver of the keyboard
- On the sound of the horn, make all your tests pass - go GREEN
- When you are at green write down the number of tests currently passing and the time it took to go green since the horn sounded on your station timesheet
- Hand in your timesheet to Game Master
- Put your GREEN Cover over your workstation
- Wait for further instructions

### Retrospective (<5 minutes)

- Dialogue (brainstorming, gather data, <2 minutes)
- Discussion (argue, generate insights, <2 minutes)
- Decision (decide what to do, reach concensus, <1 minute)

### Rules of the game

- You must never work alone! Always communicate with your programming partners.
- You must follow a proper test-driven development cycle:  
  1. Add a failing unittest  
  2. Write code until the unittest succeeds  
  3. Refactor code  
  4. Goto step 1
- You must never transfer code digitally between the work stations
- You are not allowed to "cheat" - the aim of the game is to learn and have fun
