# userTokenID

> 💡 _The **session**<sub>~representation for a user</sub>~session in Whydah SSO_

You can find the **userTokenID** as a part of a [UserToken](UserToken.md) given an successful user-authorization to [SecurityTokenService](SecurityTokenService.md) with the applications own [UserCredential](UserCredential.md).  To enable an application to authenticate users, the application itself has to authenticate itself and use its [applicationTokenID](applicationTokenID.md).
