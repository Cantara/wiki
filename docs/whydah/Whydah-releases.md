# Whydah Releases

- Latest stable release: **Whydah 2.5**

A bug fix release follows a stable release, when necessary. Bug fix releases add a sequence number to the product release number. Thus, the first bug fix release for Whydah **2.0** will be version **2.0.1**, then **2.0.2**, as necessary. A bug fix release replaces the previous stable release.

Bug fix releases are follow-ons to stable releases. Bug fix versions automatically start at stability **"rc"**, reflecting the fact that only localized bug fixes are expected to be included in such a release. Once all desired bug fixes are in place, a stability vote (to "stable") is followed by a release vote.
