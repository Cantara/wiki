# User authorization

[Authorization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization) is the function of specifying access rights to resources.

Whydah supports [role-based access control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control). This means that a user is given a *role* in for a certain application.

Whydah also supports the concept of [On-behalf-of relations](/web/20210624224353/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/whydah/On-behalf-of+relations "On-behalf-of relations").

See also [UIB Data storage - persistence](/web/20210624224353/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/whydah/UIB+Data+storage+-+persistence "UIB Data storage - persistence") for details on how authorization data is stored.
