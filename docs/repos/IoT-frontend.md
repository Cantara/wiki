## Hystrix

We recomend to enhance your remote http calls within Hystrix Commands. 
It is quite simple, have a look at the ProxyExampleResource.

To generate example data use http://<host>:<port>/IotFrontend/proxy?url=<some_host_to_get_data_from>



This application will forward Hystrix statistics and metrics on http://<host>:<adminPort>/hystrix.stream.
Use a Hystrix dashboard to view these data. See https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/tree/master/hystrix-dashboard
