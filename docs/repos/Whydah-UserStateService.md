# Whydah-UserStateService

## Overview
Whydah-UserStateService (USS) is a service within the Whydah ecosystem that manages and tracks user state information. It provides functionality for monitoring user login statuses, handling old and deleted user accounts, and maintaining application state.

## Features
- **User Login Status Tracking**: Monitor and manage user login statuses over time
- **Old User Detection**: Identify and process user accounts that have been inactive for specified periods
- **Deleted User Management**: Maintain records of deleted user accounts
- **Notification System**: Send emails to inactive users via configurable templates
- **Application State Management**: Store and retrieve application-wide state information
- **RESTful API**: Expose user state operations through a well-defined API

## Technology Stack
- **Java 21**: Core programming language
- **Stingray Framework**: Base application framework from Cantara
- **Hibernate ORM**: Object-relational mapping for database operations
- **PostgreSQL/H2**: Database options for persistence
- **FlyWay**: Database migration tool
- **Resilience4j**: Circuit breaker and resilience patterns
- **Hazelcast**: Distributed caching and data grid
- **Logback & SLF4J**: Logging infrastructure
- **Swagger**: API documentation

## Architecture
The application follows a modular architecture with several key components:
- **Repository Layer**: Data access objects for persistence operations
- **Service Layer**: Business logic implementation
- **Resource Layer**: REST API endpoints
- **Entity Layer**: Data models representing the domain
- **Module Layer**: Specialized functional components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 21 JDK
- Maven 3.5+
- PostgreSQL (for production) or H2 (for development)

### Building the Project
```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Running the Service
```bash
java -jar target/UserStateService-1.11.6-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Configuration
Configure the application by modifying the following files:
- `src/main/resources/uss/application.properties`: Main configuration file
- `src/main/resources/uss/service-authorization.properties`: Security settings
- `src/main/resources/logback.xml`: Logging configuration

## API Documentation
When the service is running, Swagger documentation is available at:
```
http://localhost:8080/api/docs
```

## Database
The service supports two database engines:
- **H2**: Used for development and testing
- **PostgreSQL**: Recommended for production use

Database migrations are managed through Flyway and located in `src/main/resources/db/migration/`.

## Integration with Whydah
This service is a component of the larger Whydah Identity and Access Management platform. It requires proper configuration to connect to other Whydah components such as SecurityTokenService (STS) and UserIdentityBackend (UIB).

## Development

### Code Structure
- `entity`: Database entity classes
- `exception`: Application exception handling
- `model`: Data transfer objects
- `repository`: Data access layer
- `resource`: API endpoints
- `service`: Business logic
- `settings`: Configuration classes
- `util`: Utility classes

### Testing
