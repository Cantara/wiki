# ListDial concept

### App description

Fast. Intuitive. Simple. 

ListDial allow you to manage multiple lists of contacts you are going to call. 
Whenever ready to make the calls just push the Call’em button. 

Very useful for sales people on the road, if you make a lot of phone calls from your car, or if you plan calls you are going to make up front. 
The app use txt-files in a dedicated Dropbox folder to store lists, making it is very easy to sync your lists across multiple devices. 

### Concept wireframes

### *.txt-format for storing
List name = filename (Make sure to check for conflicts when adding new list)
```
# Comment about the format 
# CallStatus - x marks already called; Number; Name ; Comment
# Ideally it also parses correct without the call status in front, and name/comment after to make it easier to add manually.
