oh
[12:06:46] Leif H. Auke: we must adjust cacluation method :)
[12:06:56] Leif H. Auke: 1. not move to fast
[12:07:04] Leif H. Auke: 2. changing directions
[12:07:28] Leif H. Auke: 3. move with a certain area, for ex a circle of 2km diameter
[12:08:07] Leif H. Auke: 4. when getting long = 180 -> move to -180 :)
[12:08:26] Leif H. Auke: (word is a ball)
[12:08:49] Leif H. Auke: -> lets do later, or I can do this weekend
[12:09:02] Leif H. Auke: but restart demo server to initiate drones again
[12:09:11] Duong Thanh Huy: if it's not moving fast then it's hard to see them moving
[12:09:22] Duong Thanh Huy: just very small change in the position
[12:09:24] Thai Huynh: OK, i do now
[12:10:10] Leif H. Auke: yes, but in real life drones only move within a small area, so we might zoom to 18 and abouve to see movements ?
[12:10:36] Leif H. Auke: Thai -> Q: can you center the map on drone position when clicking on a drone ?
[12:10:46] Leif H. Auke: make is more easy zoom down
[12:11:22] Leif H. Auke: or -> dbl-click on a drone automatically zoom to 18 (for ex.)
