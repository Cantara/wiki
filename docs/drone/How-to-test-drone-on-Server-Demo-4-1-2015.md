1. Go to http://89.221.242.66:8080/drone/ look overall map with center position is HCM city. (e.g Current level zoom is 3) 
2. Zoom in/out map and take ~10s then you will see drones(red marker) show other positions on map  (Notes: dummy data make for some country: VN, OSLO, CANADA, UK, LONDON)
3. Zoom out positions on map and take ~10s then look drones moving in current boundary/zoom

Notes: this is just draft version, I and Huy stilling continuos improvement and upgrade every days from Leif's Support.

Issues: Since every 10s send request into server maybe impact performance when load map API from google also for drones on map

Good luck!
