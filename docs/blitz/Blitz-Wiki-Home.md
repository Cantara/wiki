| |  | **Mission** The purpose of the Blitz project is to further the use of JavaSpaces and JINI TM through the provision of essential resources such as: 1. Pattern library - these patterns should be available in both code and document forms and will provide users with solutions to common (and hopefully more advanced) issues.  2. Openly available implementations of various services, tools and frameworks - developed and refined over time, based on the experience of people using them in anger.  3. Deployment examples - reference information concerning the ways in which JavaSpaces and JINI technologies have been applied in the real world. These will be useful to both architects and administrators.  We believe that the best way to achieve the above is in an open, co-operative manner thus Blitz is an [OpenSource](http://www.opensource.org/) project. Until recently, SUN's approach to JINI licensing [made things difficult](http://dancres.org/cottage/scsl_probs.html), but JINI is now licensed under [ALv2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/).  Many thanks to all those people who have contributed to the project in various ways so far. |   ---  Blitz - Javaspaces Made Simple The Blitz JavaSpaces TM implementation aims to provide a rich set of features to make the development & deployment of JavaSpaces technology easier, more efficient and more fun to experiment with.  The Blitz Project is the first Jini TM 2.x compliant JavaSpace to be made available under an OpenSource license .  **Key features**  - Ease of installation. - Jini 2.x enabled. - Use of established VM principles. - Smart indexing. - Tuneable persistence. - Tools. - Entry Browsing. - Embeddable Space support. - Active/Passive/Manual lease cleanup. - Built for experimentation and expansion. - Easy integration with the Inca X IDE & Runtime Environment. | News [Thor Henning Hetland](/web/20220525142552/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/~totto) posted on Sep 03, 2008 [Established Blitz Wiki](/web/20220525142552/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/blitz/2008/09/03/Established+Blitz+Wiki)  As discussed on the blitz mailing list, we have started a Blitz wiki. Initial navigation and some of the core content (FAQ and product sheets) are migrated. Chck it out and feel free to add content and comment on existing content  Totto-08 |
