# Can I View the Entry's in a Blitz JavaSpace?

Yes, as of Pure Java version 1.06 there is support for com.sun.jini.outrigger.JavaSpaceAdmin which will allow any appropriate Service Browser (e.g. the community edition from Inca X) to view and manipulate the Entry's held within a Blitz instance.

If you still have questions, subscribe to the [users list](http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=126322) and post questions there or [submit](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=126322&atid=705208) a support request.
