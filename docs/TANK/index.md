The intention is to use this space as an incubator for wiki content on various topics until the content has grown enough to warrant a separate space. The suggested topics to put into this space are for instance:  - Content related to alternative languages on the JVM - Patterns, idioms, tips and tricks for effective programming in your favorite language - Domain Driven Design in practice   **Please feel free to share your ideas and postulates for discussion and rubberducking here** | | - [grails](/web/20100823233758/http://wiki.cantara.no/label/TANK/grails) |
