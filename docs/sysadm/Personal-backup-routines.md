# Personal backup routines

> 💡 
> 💡 Before creating a "problem" let us take a close look at our 2013 world. Today most if not all data could/should start its life in the system/cloud/web. It should also be continuously stay updated there, and all distribution should be from there. And those solutions are already backed up. So, you should really look at all local data (i.e. data on your computer) as the active backup, thus no need for a backup of the backup...

By backup we are actually thinking about _restore_. It is the restore capability we are interested in, backups are only a means to an end. 

#### Personal backup routines 

- Commit/push early and often. No big change set to loose locally. 

- Store files in a medium which is backed up, available off-line and supports synchronization. For example https://www.dropbox.com/.  

- Configuration for applications etc. can either be backed up to the file store or persisted in other available systems. 

- Documentation: online wiki like for example http://wiki.cantara.no. 

Changing your work patterns reduce and mostly eliminate the need to backup your personal computer.
