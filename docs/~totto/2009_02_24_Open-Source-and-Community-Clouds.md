# Open Source and Community Clouds

### StratusLab

**StratusLab** is an informal collaboration between CNRS/LAL, GRNET, SixSq Sàrl, and UCM. The collaboration is open to anyone who would like to participate. The collaboration focuses on cloud technologies and how those technologies can be used productively in research and commercial environments.

The key issue with productive use of the technologies is effective management of the cloud resources. For broad adoption, cloud resources must be managable with the same (or similar) techniques currently used by administrators of data centers. The initial activities of the collaboration will investigate how different management techniques can be adapted to cloud resources.

### EUCALYPTUS - Elastic Utility Computing Architecture for Linking Your Programs To Useful Systems

**EUCALYPTUS - Elastic Utility Computing Architecture for Linking Your Programs To Useful Systems** - is an open-source software infrastructure for implementing "cloud computing" on clusters. The current interface to EUCALYPTUS is compatible with Amazon's EC2 interface, but the infrastructure is designed to support multiple client-side interfaces. EUCALYPTUS is implemented using commonly available Linux tools and basic Web-service technologies making it easy to install and maintain.

The current release is version 1.3 and it includes the following features:

- Interface compatibility with EC2 (both Web service and Query interfaces)
- Simple installation and deployment using Rocks cluster-management tools
- Stand-alone RPMs for non-Rocks RPM based systems
- Secure internal communication using SOAP with WS-security
- Overlay functionality requiring no modification to the target Linux environment
- Basic "Cloud Administrator" tools for system management and user accounting
- The ability to configure multiple clusters, each with private internal network addresses, into a single Cloud.
