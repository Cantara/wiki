# [Blog] Transparancy is essensial to security in the cloud

I'm always chocked by comments like this:

So let's start with the nonsensical idea that your cloud infrastructure is secure.

It is 2009, and the whole idea of any secure infrastructure is just totally **naive**..

Your cloud infrastructure is likely _secured_ with respect to some requirements, but it's just as certain to be insecure for other requirements. The cloud has nothing to do with this. **Every infrastructure on the planet is secure for some requirements and insecure for others**. 

> 💡 If your cloud provider refuses to answer any specific question about their security architecture related to your security requirements, run—don't walk—away from that vendor.
