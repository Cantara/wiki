# [Blog] Sinnataggen and some Cloud development thoughts...

**"if the cloud were a child, it would be an angry two year old. The challenge for the industry now is how to make it through the terrible twos."**

According to Gartner, the important criteria for a cloud development platform include:

    * Interoperability: how well does the platform integrate with other web assets like open id and google maps?
    * Collaboration: how well does the platform support source code control and social programming (Facebook meets SVN)
    * RIA & mobile clients: cross browser and cross smart-phone support. According to Mark, reach wins over richness - supporting more browsers is more important than supporting more widgets.
    * Legacy: ability to integrate with enterprise data, security and web services
    * Performance: ability to scale significantly with no additional effort/programming
    * Longevity: the market momentum of the platform vendor - will they be around in 3 years? The winner will be less about the raw technology and more about the quality of partners and customers the vendor has attracted.
