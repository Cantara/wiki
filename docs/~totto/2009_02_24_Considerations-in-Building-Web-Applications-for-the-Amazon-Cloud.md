# Considerations in Building Web Applications for the Amazon Cloud

- 1. Licensing - If you stay Open Source you are OK... Commercial Licences may kill your budget..
- 2. Persistence - Application persistence.. Amazon does not like filesystems, use DB for persistence...
- 3. Horizontal Scalability. Not sure that this gets the point.. vertical scalabillity should work even better on Amazone. Anyone?
- 4. Disaster Recovery. Its a distributed system - cope and be happy
