# [Blog] Cloud definition misses the point....

Here are the three criteria I have for determining whether something is a cloud service or not:

   1. The service is accessible via a web browser (non-proprietary) or web services API.
   2. There is zero capital expenditure required to get started.
   3. You pay only for what you use as you use it.
