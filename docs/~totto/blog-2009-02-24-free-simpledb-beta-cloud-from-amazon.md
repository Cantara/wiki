# [Blog] Free SimpleDB Beta Cloud from Amazon

For "at least" the next six months, Amazon will provide a certain amount of free cloud sitting. Every month, SimpleDB users will receive 25 machine hours, 1GB of data transfers in, 1GB of transfers out, and 1GB of storage at no charge. Once those freebies are exhausted, you'll pay $0.14 per machine hour, $0.10 per GB in, $0.10 to $0.17 per GB out, and $0.25 per GB of storage. Storage pricing is down 83 per cent from the cloud's limited beta.

You can also transfer an unlimited amount of data from EC2 at no charge.
