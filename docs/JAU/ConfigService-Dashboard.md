| **The ConfigService Dashboard consist of the following responsibilities**   - Create application, add application config, update application config. - Register Client, and link this client to an existing application config. - Easy to grasp overview of the CS provisioned application(s) instances - Drill-down of the provisioned applications to analyze and pinpoint issues - Easy to use common provisioning operations   - Upgrade application, application instance   - View, edit and provision new configuration for     - a) all clients for a given application     - b) a single client - Question: **wizard**-type process-flow to add new application(s)?   - baardl: Yes, that is needed. This process should guide the user into easy to add a new application, and possibly new client-specifig configuration.  - Nice to have:   - Link to cloudwatch from clientId's.  Some key CS Dashboard userstories We split the user stories into four categories, and try to prioritize strictly when moving forward  **1. Priority**   - #1 - #2   **2. Priority**   - #3 - #4 As a system administrator, I want to change the configuration of ONE of the managed application instances to handle a certain planned event - #9 As a system administrator, I want to get a graphical visualization of the application(s), applicationConfigurations and connected clients for my ConfigService - #10 As an administrator, I want to find and inspect clients which have some data in their events/logs/environment/configuration.   **3. Priority**   - #5 As a system administrator, I want to get an early warning of pending system(s) failure - #6 As a system administrator, I want to see the impact of various network failures for my application instances - #7 As a system administrator, I want to see the the behavior of an application instance over time (history view - need CS Dashboard cache/persistence for this)  ---   **Not prioritized**   - #8 As a system administrator, I want to tag clients, to create groups/hierarchies of sets of managed applications to add support for simple cause-impact scenarios | Shortcuts  - [Installing ConfigService Dashboard](/web/20210228125919/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/JAU/Installing+ConfigService+Dashboard "Installing ConfigService Dashboard") - [ConfigService APIs](/web/20210228125919/https://wiki.cantara.no/display/JAU/ConfigService+APIs "ConfigService APIs") - <https://github.com/Cantara/ConfigService-Dashboard>  Early screenshots of ConfigService Dashboard |  |  | | --- | --- | |  |  | |  |  | |  |  | |  |  | |  |  | |  |  | |  |  | |  |  | |
