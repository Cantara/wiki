# How can I be available for the development team

## How can I be available to the development team?

1. Sit with the development team, in a landscape.
2. Be prepared to do noting else than listen and answer questions when by your desk.
3. Short discussions (with developers and users) by the desk, more than 5-10 min -> closest meeting room.
