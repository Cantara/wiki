# Solid C++ by Example

### Abstract

Sometimes you see code that is perfectly OK according to the definition of the language but which is flawed because it breaks to many established idioms and conventions of the language. This will be an interactive session with discussions about good vs bad C++ code. We will discuss simple C++ idioms and coding conventions, but we will also touch upon best practices when working with C++ in large codebases with lots of developers with mixed skills.
