# Why architects always gets in my face..

# Or more politically correct - What have I done to get the Architect breathing down my neck :)

## Who is this architect person?
 * If he is God, I must be the one who has done wrongly
 * Lives in a castle far far away
 * Have established a good network and high status in the organization
 * Imposes rules by diagrams, powerpoints and paper napkins containing boxes and arrows, 
 * Strives for control and a model which has to change as little as possible (Generic)

## Who am I?
 * Suffer from Primadonna Developer Syndrom
 * Acknowledge that others know more than me, and that I lack experience 
 * Keep myself updated with the latest fabs and use them in my projects
 * Prefer to do things my way with the tools I prefer (IntelliJ, Maven...)
 * Have developed a pet hate for certain frameworks and misconceptions (BIg coMpany vendors, if(debugIsTrue))
 * Hate flexible, generalized architecture when not needed
 * Hate black boxes which do simple things developers fear to touch. Means that one can't solve it with simpler solutions

## What do I do?
 * Common quotes; "I've just read of someone else on Twitter doing...", "I've got an idea...", "Why is this?", "Can't this be done diffrently?"
 * Strive for simplicity or just a different way of handling things, which clashes with the rules
 * Goldplating - Will refactor code and API's whenever 
 * Will use alot of time to rewrite things my way under the belief that it will improve performance

## Summarized
 * Distance to architect
 * How is architecture communicated? Models, wiki, paper, in peoples heads?
 * Can developers change the architecture/architects meaning?
 * Time since architect was hands on
 * Even though I agree on the goal, how to get there can differ substantially. If we both cannot adapt to another, problems will follow.
