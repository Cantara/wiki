# Practical Tips for Rakudo Star

Perl 6 has been under development for many years. "Rakudo" is the Perl 6 implementation on top of the Parrot virtual machine, and it about to have its first release defined as "usable" by its main developers. This release is called Rakudo \* (Star).

In this talk Rune will show you how to get hold of Rakudo, tell you ways Perl 6 will be quicker to program in than Perl 5 and other languages, and give an idea on how it can help you avoid bugs in your code.
