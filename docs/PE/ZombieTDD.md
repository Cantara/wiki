### ZombieTDD

About half a year ago Magnar Sveen sat down with the goal of making a game 100% written in JavaScript. It has JavaScript both in the client and on the server (running on node.js) and as the perfectionist Magnar is it's written TDD style. This turned into a series of JavaScript TDD screen casts he has put online.  
Magnars will share his thoughts and experience on doing TDD JavaScript development and how his experiments with reusing the same code on both client and server turned out.
