#### Motivation

- **Help the industry to make the next step forward**

- **Gather the best possible set of industry-experts to spend a full two days together in discussions on how to push the market to new levels...**

Experts often end up with the responsibility for taking important decisions, but frequently find themselves isolated and without peers to discuss these decisions with. If this applies to you, you now have the opportunity to work with other experts, which will give you enthusiasm, energy and new ideas for improving your working life.

#### Work and results

- Several workshops during the two day cruise.
- A clear and consistent flow of discussions, prioritized by participants.
- Live publication of work-in-progress enables feedback, documentation and discussions from off-site participants.
- All results will be licensed under Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution license.

- Produce two presentations for IASA meeting in June 2009
