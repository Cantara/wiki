# Mission impossible? - A large SharePoint solution without custom code

### Mission impossible? - A large SharePoint solution without custom code

Statoil needed to roll out a SharePoint 2010 solution quickly, and their policy is to focus on what is available out-of-the-box. From day one, the solution would store more than 50,000 documents and consume more than 400 GB of storage. Also, users were dissatisfied with their current SharePoint 2003 end-user experience, both from a consumer and a contributor point of view. Delivering on both the technical and functionality requirements with mainly out-of-the-box functionality turned out to be challenging, but far from impossible.
