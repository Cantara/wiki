# Geek Cruise III 2009 - Scalability in 2009

### Introduction

Scalability has in the recent years become more and more vital in software development. In the race to web 2.0 or enterprise 2.0 enable today's enterprises, many of the internal systems are experiencing explosion in load. At the same time, most successful web 2.0 companies have been very open with their internal architecture and experiences. This workshop intend to kill a few myths and establish a baseline for architectural options for scalable systems in 2009. By publicizing this guide, we hope to help developers and architects to make better decisions in how to plan and build for these new scalability challenges.

Experts often end up with the responsibility for taking important decisions, but frequently find themselves isolated and without peers to discuss these decisions with. If this applies to you, you now have the opportunity to work with other experts, which will give you enthusiasm, energy and new ideas for improving your working life.
