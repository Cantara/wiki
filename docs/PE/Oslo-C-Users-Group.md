# Oslo C++ Users Group

Oslo C++ Users Group (ocppug.org) is a group of enthusiasts that meet a couple of times a year to discuss and broaden our knowledge of this extremely powerful programming language and related technologies. In particular we will focus on C+0x, Boost, and advanced features of the C+ language.
If you have a solid background in C++, and if you are willing to share your knowledge and learn from others, then please sign up. You will be a valuable member of our meetup group.
