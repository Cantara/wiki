# What are the three main directions a project needs from the architect?

**Ansver**

- Define the domain and the overall task according to functional spesifications
- A proper roadmap and strategy for fullfilling the tasks
- Hand on adjustents and directions how to solve

We have all experienced the fuzzy logic of performing IT projects to success, both in timing and funtionallity, and we have all both good experiences and not so good experiences and if we look at not so good experiences this manifests both in functionallity and in timing. But in all cases someone is to blame og someone are responsible for the succesfull outcome of projects.

In all aspects it all comes down to knowledge and organisation, so the main focus for an architect should be both, either perform the knowledge and organisations or make sure this componets is providing within the projects. When this is done, the real work for architectural funn can start.

But IT projects, in contradiction to for ex. build contructs and projects have the component of unsertanty and lack of knowledge, the architetural work must adapt this uncertanty.
