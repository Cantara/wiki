# The Saturday night challenge...

### Document your two favorite Data Integration Pattern axioms in the table below before 0930 Sunday morning.

| Name | Axiom | Description | Scalability consequences |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Totto | Joining data in memory beats joining adta out of process/in db any day.. |  | why is this so hard to understand.. |
| Totto | When ever was pulling a large undetermenistic context-bound graph into your application ever a good idea.. |  |  |  |  |
| Emil | Johannes is wrong |  |
| Emil | Integration through a shared db breaks layering => high coupling | Resistant to change |
| Emil | Shared db => group ownership of schema | Fucked up shit |
| Borud | Please do not fondle my data |  |
| Johannes | The database is functionally equivallent to a service layer (or can be made to be) |  |  |
| Johannes | When exposing a database, you have to design the interface schema, you muppet |  |  |
| Dan | If you're doing data integration, you're fucked |  |  |
| Kjetil | Any data integration pattern axiom may or may not be applicable to you |  |  |
| Kjetil | Two data integration pattern axioms may be at least one too many |  |  |
| Ørjan | We need one and only one model for each service, and how data is persisted is nobodys business but the service itself |  |  |
