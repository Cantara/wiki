# Architects and testing - brainstorming

#### Why the responsibility of the _architect_? 

- Testability and ease of deployment automation must be weighed against the other drivers for the project. This is by definition (at least my definition) the responsibility of the architect. 
    - I.e., the architecture should support automated testing and automated deployment, not hinder it. 

- Standardization across applications/services. 
    - Synergy effects (yes, I hate that word too) 

- Knowledge and experience 
    - Can/should see the whole picture -> avoid sub-optimization 
    - The architect is probably also one of the few in an organization which can actually make it happen. 

- Some decisions must be made early (upfront?) 
    - A LOT cheaper to do right the first time (avoid every team reinventing the wheel) 

#### Why think about it at all? 

- Reduce risk 

- Save time and money 

- Promotes agile development
