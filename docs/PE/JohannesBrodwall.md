# JohannesBrodwall

Johannes Brodwall is just-a-programmer. He's been programming for ten years and has found that in order to be just-a-programmer, one needs to create an environment in where creativity can happen. In order to do this, Johannes has acted as architect on some large (~100 devs) and some small (2-5 devs) projects over the years. After a while, he discovered that a culture of quality cannot be limited to a project, so he decided to contribute to the local development community in form of talks (every year at JavaZone), organizing user groups (Oslo XP meetup since 2004) and organizing conferences (Smidig 2007, 2008, 2009). He is opinionated and somewhat annoying.
