# Haskell - Modularity++

### Haskell: Modularity++ 

**Vidar Holen**

Why Haskell? Impressive one-liners and functional philosophy is great, but why on earth would anyone think that maintainability and extensibility could be improved by replacing straight forward code with abstract mathematics? This talk tells the story of one procedural programmer’s reluctance to join the object oriented world, and from there, suggests the next logical steps in the same direction. Maybe “straight forward” isn’t as straight forward as it seems?
