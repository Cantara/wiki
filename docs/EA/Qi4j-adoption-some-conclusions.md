# Qi4j adoption - some conclusions

- incremental adoption seems unlikely, as Qi4j does not support it. 

- "All-in" approach seems the way to do it. And this seems hard. 

- All of the benefits of Qi4j can be implemented using basic AOP with AspectJ. 

Sergei's anti-corruption layer example illustrates this. 

We want **COP**! 

To views on adoption: 

1. Adoption of COP 
1. Adoption of Qi4j. 

Perhaps adoption of Qi4j would be feasible if DDD and COP concepts were known by the average developer.
