### Intro

 The **Emerging Technologies - the future of enterprise POJOS** is the first in a series of open seminars/workshops. The idea is to facilitate discussions between *thought leaders* and *peers* on important aspects of the software development. We believe that the results will increase the knowledge, skills and value produced by software professionals.  The workshop participants and the on-line community will collaborate on the process and agenda, and all results will be posted *live* to this wiki and thus stay free and open to everyone.  Initial announcement: [About:/2008/07/02/Emerging technology \- the future of the enterprise pojos]  |  | **Workshop goals**   1. Establish a exciting and fun discussion for important emerging enterprise technologies 2. Document ideas, different views and key findings to the open community 3. Provide a *indpendent thought leader baseline* for further work in the enterprise Pojo arena 4. Document starting points and directions for projects and architecture to everyone interested | |  |

### Agenda

Emerging technology; extending the object in enterprise context. This agenda meant as a very tentative guideline. The group will change direction and speed acording to the findings and ideas as we go. The timeslots are just meant as a *kind of timeline*. As time flies we will have a great mix of talks, demos, discussions, lightening talks, peer programming, beer drinking, heavy fights and lots of fun..
