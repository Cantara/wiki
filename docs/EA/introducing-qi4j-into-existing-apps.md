# introducing qi4j into existing apps

- large tutorial for introducing qi4j into an existing application is needed - the proposed step by step for petstore would be good. 
- coexisting with spring ?
- coexisting with hibernate ?
- there is "a lot" of good stuff, but perhaps too much to eat at once - how to introduce bit by bit to others while at the same time deliver functionality ?
- would like a possible fallback route if qi4j introduction fails
