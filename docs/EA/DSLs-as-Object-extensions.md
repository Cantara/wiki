# DSLs as Object extensions

This session will provide insight into how we can use Domain Specific Languages to express business rules and processes using the ubiquitous language our domain model defines. We'll start off by taking the plain old Java approach of fluent interfaces, move on to building scriptable domain models and finish off by investigating how we can use modern languages as a foundation for defining DSLs for our models.

(Warning: One of the languages used in this session is language targeting Microsoft's CLR, but I might have a trick or two up my sleeve to make it run on the Java VM
