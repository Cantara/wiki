# Semantic System Models

### Strategy

- System levels
  - City maps
  - Block maps
  - Building schematics/floor plans
    - A system is phycically located on a floor in a building
    - systems which spawn several buildings in combination with other systems are **key pain points** and should be considered for **split&rule** sub-system interfaces.

### Definitions

- A system or a sub-system supports a set of business processes and business objects
- The business process is the logical mapping between Semantic Process View models and Technology Implementation roles.. implemented by systems and/or services.
