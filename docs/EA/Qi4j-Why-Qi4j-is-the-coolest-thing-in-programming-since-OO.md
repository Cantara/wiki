# Qi4j - Why Qi4j is the coolest thing in programming since OO

Responsible: Richard Öberg

This introduction will provide some background on Qi4j, and discuss why ObjectOrientation and AspectOrientation, while useful stepping stones, have failed to make enterprise software development, especially with a DDD focus, any easier.

Rickard will explain what Composite Oriented Programming - which Qi4j is an implementation of - is, and what the main features are. Specifically, how COP makes DDD easier, and also makes it easier to write reusable code. We will also look at some code and tools which are already available.
