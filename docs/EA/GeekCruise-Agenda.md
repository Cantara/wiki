# GeekCruise Agenda

Emerging technology; extending the object in enterprise context. This agenda meant as a very tentative guideline. The group will change direction and speed acording to the findings and ideas as we go. The timeslots are just meant as a *kind of timeline*. As time flies we will have a great mix of talks, demos, discussions, lightening talks, peer programming, beer drinking, heavy fights and lots of fun..
