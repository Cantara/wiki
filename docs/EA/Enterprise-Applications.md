# Enterprise Applications

Some attributes and problems with enterprise applications:

- Business critical (Alistair Cockburn: Essential Moneys => Failure can cause unreperarable financial damage to the company, but not loss of life)
- Many people involved (Inside and outside the project)
- Other systems involved
- Diffused responsibility
- Long lived (often reincarnated)
