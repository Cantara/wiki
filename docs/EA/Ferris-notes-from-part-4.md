# Ferris' notes from part 4

The Mountain.

EDR

Big discussion on repositories. Took forever to get through the discussion. Good stuff :)

Johannes: Don't centralize.

Rickard: Assume duplication, prepare for synchronization.

Think the EDR guys got some good input on stuff they need to improve and clarify.
