**Dear JavaZone speaker!**

JavaZone is getting close and we ask you to read the following important information carefully:

**Speaker's Dinner**
As previously communicated, our traditional event - Speaker's Dinner - will this year take place in the restaurant Oslo Mekaniske Verksted on Tuesday September 16, at 1900h. A great chance to get to know the other speakers and the people responsible for creating this great event!

For those interested, we will meet up outside main entrance of the JavaZone conference venue, Oslo Spektrum Arena, at 1800h for a quick tour, before we head over to the restaurant. Oslo Spektrum lies parallel to Radisson SAS Plaza Hotel and just walking distance from Oslo Central Train Station.

**Speaker's tickets** 
You need a ticket in order to be admitted into the conference venue. The ticket must be worn when inside the conference venue, or security might throw you out. There will be a special speaker's entrance at Spektrum Arena, on the side towards the Oslo Plaza Hotel, see linked photo below. A JavaZone crew at the entrance will hand you the ticket and provide you with information on how to find the speaker's lounge.
