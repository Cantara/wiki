# Infomail om deadline for levering av slides

Hi <name>,

This years JavaZone conference is approaching fast and the JavaZone Program Committee are working hard to make sure that JavaZone 2009 will be the best ever!

The JavaZone speakers' technical preferences are as diverse as the speakers themselves, so to ensure that all presentations will run smoothly, _we need to have your final presentation slides at the latest **Monday September 6th**_.

We ask that you use the confirmation link for your presentation to upload your slides. There are two uploads forms, one for slides which we will provide as a backup at the venue, and one for pdf which will be published online. File size are 20 MB for the pdf and 30 MB for slides. If this is too small, please let us know.

This is to make sure that your slides will run without problems on the equipment that will be used at the conference. To limit the potential for problems we ask that you send us your presentation in either Microsoft PowerPoint, Apple Keynote or PDF-format.

Bottom line: Please send your final presentation slides in PowerPoint, Keynote or PDF-format to program@java.no by _Monday September 6th_.

Looking forward to seeing you at JavaZone 2009!

Best Regards,
The JavaZone Program Committee
