Hi,

Yes, I've just looked at flights and for a Sept. 8 - Sept. 11  
itinerary flights are under $US1000.  How will the reimbursement  
work?  Will the hotel be automatically covered?  For how many nights?   
Is there a speakers agreement with the reimbursement details?

What day/time will my talk be scheduled?

I'd be happy to book the flights and speak at this conference once any  
agreement details are in place.

Thanks for working with me through this.

	Erik

Hi Erik,

Sorry, but don't have the capacity to buy flight tickets for  
speakers as
we are a group of volunteers who organize this on our free time. I'm
also quite sure that it is cheaper to buy tickets in the US than in
Norway.

Most other people coming from the US area able to get a flight for
around US$1200. If you can get a ticket for this price then we will be
able to cover it for you (in addition to hotel).

Regards,
Per
