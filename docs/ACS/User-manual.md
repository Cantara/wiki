## Introduction

### A competence system in action

ACS - Awesome Competence System - is not just a CV-system, it is a **competence management system**.

It is built around persons and CV's, a person may have mutliple CVs with shared information. This can be illustrated like this.

  - Quick access and verification of candidates for specific needs

- ***CV production***
  - Good support for showing the candidates best sides compared with different roles and profiles
  - Good support for detailed adjustments and showcasing skills and experiences.
  - Production of CV Documents for further adjutments and distribution

  - Quick and quality assured production of competency matrixes with connections to experiences
  - Reuseable rankings

- ***Knowlegde building and knowledge governance***

The solution is under continous development in order to even better support these features in the future.  
Especially the competence matrix section is in early alfa stage, and updates and adjustments in this area must be expected.|

### Core components

ACS is built around the following core components that every person actively maintains.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | **Person** with name, personal info, department and office.  - **Competences**. Key qualifications as competence categories e.g. Methods, Technologies, Tools, and Roles. For each competence category specify included competences like RUP, Java, Hibernate and Scrum Master. This should not be a summary of the persons profile, this belongs to the CV and will be added later. - **Workplaces**. Current and previous employments. - **Assignments/Experience**. Work experiences, assignments, projects or roles that you have had, most likely as part of an employment. - **Education**. Formal education to be added here - **Other**. Somewhat more free what you want to add here. Publications, important roles, certifications etc are all good examples of information to add here. |

- If only start year and month are added to a workplace or assignment this means that it is ongoing. Wil be written in CV as e.g: '2010 Feb - ongoing'.

|  | **CV** with role and profile.  - ACS supports multiple CV profiles for any person. One CV is created per profile. - On the CV you may choose which of the entries under person that is relevant to include. - The role and profile texts creates the "first impression" one wants to give from this given profile. |
|  | **Knowledge matrix (Beta)** with a collection of skillsets questioned for a task/mission or bid.  - **Rating** that consists of a knowledge description, scoring and references to experience elements that visualize that the scoring is correct in that specific area. |
|

Note that a CV may exist in two languages, the native language it was written in (Currently supporting Norwegian and Swedish) and English.  
The language of the Native template is decided by the language associated with the office where the person is working.

## Altran spesifics

Use your word based CV as a template and enter all information in ACS.

A tip is to use cut and paste via notepad or the Paste-feature in the right hand side tools menu.

Do not put to much information under workplace, all project experiences should go in as *Assignments/Experiences*.   
You might want to hightlight Technologies and Tools under *Competences*
