###### Definition of success 

- **Who** defines success? 
    - Different actors have different views on success.
    - Buyer, product owner, user, developer, architect, operations, support 

- **When** to determine success or failure? 
    - When in production? 
    - After 1 year? 5 years? 30 years? 
    - After end of life? 

- Was the Mongstad project a success? 
    - Almost 10 billion (milliarder) NOK in profits in 2004-2008. 
    - 9,2 billion NOK devaluations (nedskrivninger) in 2009-2011
    - Statoil is considering all options for the future of Mongstad oil refinery

###### How to improve success rate? 

- “The highest-level breakdown of a system into its parts; the **decisions that are hard to change**; there are multiple architectures in a system; what is architecturally significant can change over a system's lifetime; and, in the end, architecture boils down to whatever the important stuff is.” Src: _Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture_, Martin Fowler
    - Decisions that are hard to change... Poor architecture - certain failure? 

- What are the the main factors to put in place _early_ in the project? 
    - What are the key mechanisms which tip the balance towards success? 
    - [Feedback loops](../architecture/Learning-circle.md)? Customer involvement? Methodology? Size? Technology? Architecture? [The Project Management Triangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle)? 

- How to determine which projects to _cancel_? 
    - Early warning signs?
