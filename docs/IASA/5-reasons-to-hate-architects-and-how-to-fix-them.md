# 5 reasons to hate architects and how to fix them

Also called 5 signs that your architect should be neutered

- Policies and no feedback-loops
    - Easier to micromanage and make decisions about simple and technology-related stuff than the more complex issues. 

- Myths - **TODO Totto**: opplæringskostnad vs frata tech leads valgmuligheter (f.eks. låse ned versjoner på biblioteker) 

- Ivory tower - not accountable, not available.  

- Powerpoint-architects: Boxes and arrows that look great in powerpoint, but are not always possible to implement. 
    - No/little hands-on -> to great distance between developers and current technology/solutions and the architects making the decisions.
