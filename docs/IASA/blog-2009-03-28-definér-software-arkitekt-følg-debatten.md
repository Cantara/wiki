I forrige runde av IASAs oppstart i Oslo gikk debatten hett rundt definisjonen av Arkitektbegrepet. Nå er debatten også igang hos vår mor-organisasjon.

How do you define a software architect?
What is the true definition of a software architect?
Is it:
a) software developer with 5+ years of experience
b) someone who doesnt write code
c) someone who knows the business model, objective, licensing models

-----
the architect is responsible for the following:
-Understanding the business model and translating it into overall IT objectives
-Understanding the technology stack and how it supports the business objectives
-Providing a road map of the technologies used
-Ensuring the tactical development steps support strategic goals 
-----
basically, i think it's a set of skills falling into these categories:
* technical skills which include knowledge about software designs & development, tools, methodologies, patterns and practices, trends in software development, etc.
* soft management skills including abilities focusing on people, time and tasks management
* soft communication skills to be able to liaise with senior management (cio, ceo) from one end and technical personnel (PM's, tech leads) from the other
------
An architect is responsible for determining how best to deliver value to the various stakeholders: end users, admins, the development organization, channel partners, etc.
