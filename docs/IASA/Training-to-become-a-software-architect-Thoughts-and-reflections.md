#### Abstract 
I want to be a software architect. What must I do? Read books? Go to courses? Take SUN/Oracle/Microsoft certifications? Be an expert programmer? Can anyone train to become a great software architect? 

As an aspiring software architect I want to give you my thoughts and reflections on training to become a software architect.
