# Forbedre Architecture Kompetanse

Interesting workshop in the [SEI](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/) about how to improve the sw architecture competence in an organisation:

- [A Workshop on Architecture Competence](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/publications/documents/09.reports/09tn005.html)

Some nice architect "anti-patterns" in the experience reports also:
- The organization has outsourced much of the architecture function and is critically dependent on a labor pool outside of the organization's control. 
- The organization has outsourced development, so there is no internal source for developing architects. 
- The organization depends on a single hero architect. 
- The organization is geographically dispersed, work is distributed across teams, and problems are not discovered until integration time and are therefore costly to resolve. The root cause is divergence in the employees' understanding of the architecture. 
- The architecture team is detached from the reality of the project/business, and the architecture is likely to be late. 
- The business people are detached from the reality of the architecture and technology, and the project is likely to fail. 

Perhaps IASA.NO can run a session on how our local orgs work on architecture competence and how to avoid the architect anti-patterns?
