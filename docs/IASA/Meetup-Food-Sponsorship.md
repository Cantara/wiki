I got in touch with the manager from Technologihuset and they do not have any deals with local providers. So it is down to us to order off the menu from Pepes or Domino and have them deliver.

[12:54]   
So Peppes - is around 300kr per large pizza (feeds 2 to 3 people) + 89kr delivery

[12:56]   
So for a fully booked session I would suggest 20 pizzas - They throw in a 1.5L bottle of Coke with each pizza ordered online

[12:56]   
So 6100kr
