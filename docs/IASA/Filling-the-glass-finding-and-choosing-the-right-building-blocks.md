- Introduce the metaphore of filling a glass first with large stones, then small stones, then sand... etc
- Break down an example system into building blocks (stones)
- Sort these building blocks into different sizes
- Discuss methods of prioritising placement of the stones in the glass so that the glass becomes full enough (requirements fulfilled)
