Lets have some fun and look at some very cool Neo4J demos, covering Neo4J, Heroku, Cypher and how they make difficult stuff fun and easy?

- .Fun, values and lessons learnt from retrofitting Neo4J into the Telenor middle-ware

Telenor calculated in 2010 that it´s self-service web solution for companies & enterprises, MinBedrift, would not scale with the projected customer growth beyond 2012. In order to achieve acceptable user response times, the current solution was dependent of nightly pre-caching the customers’ data. However, the time available for caching was closing fast, and then response times would become increasingly longer. In the end Telenor would start losing customers, and a lot of money. This is the story about how usage of NoSQL solutions such as Lucene/Solr index & Neo4j graph database solved the problem, and then some more.
