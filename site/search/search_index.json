How long was the release cycle after that? The basic premise of this wiki is that any project that is not able to release to production at least once every three months has a problem. The longer the release cycle the bigger the risk of partial or complete failure. The product owner should actively work towards reducing the length of releases. It will not always be possible to release every three months but it should always be the goal a project strives after. Once a system is in production most projects should be able to release at the end of every iteration.</p> <p>The idea of releasing often is not new. Most agile approaches recommend frequent releases.

If it is not possible to identify a reasonably small MDE one should consider a delaying tactic. Develop a peripheral function that can be used both with the legacy system and the system to be. This will give the project time to learn more about the legacy system and come up with better strategies to reduce the MDE. The biggest problem with a delaying strategy is selling it to the customer's management. They will have very strong incentives to start immediately with the core parts of a new system. The value of building a peripheral function is primarily indirect (risk reduction). The costs on the other hand will be up front since development of the core functionality will be delayed. There is also a cost associated with developing the function to work with the legacy system and later modifying it to work with the new system. The case for delaying is very similar to that of refactoring. Both entail an up front cost that brings long-term benefits.</p>"},{"location":"ARS/Trojan-Project/","title":"Trojan Project","text":""},{"location":"ARS/Trojan-Project/#problemcontext","title":"Problem/Context","text":"<p>Many enterprise organizations have so much technical and architecture debt and a funding policy which effectively prevent them from moving in any direction.</p>"},{"location":"ARS/Trojan-Project/#solution","title":"Solution","text":"<p>Define a project which seems to deliver essential business value, but which has an internal Trojan which removes key debt preventing agile strategies and frequent releases.

Today\u00b4s taxonomy strategies have struggled hard to provide positive return of investment (ROI).

We believe that since the internet search engines started to rule the world, we need to rethink they way we look at information and categorization. With the new and up-coming auto-categorization services, we see a potential of shifting the effort from people to machines in taxonomy and categorization in the same way that the serach engines shifted the information gathering from catalogs to search.

Qi4j is done on top of Java to leverage the many tools available, IDEs with good refactoring being the most obvious one, but everything from a capable JVM to various classloading strategies to application servers were part of that picture. Refactoring support is a critical one, as we do modeling directly in code (i.e. by context dependent role interfaces) and models need to be flexible and easily changeable, hence the critical dependency on refactoring support. That is also a main reason for staying away from XML at all levels.

Most objects of will be private to one application. But the objects that are shared between two applications and the objects that are shared across a large number of applications in the enterprise must be treated differently. The fact that more systems depend on the same objects means we have to deal with a lot more problems. \"Enterprise POJOs\" is a term we use to discuss these issues. An \"Enterprise POJO\" is an object that is being used by (many systems? more than one system?) in the enterprise.</p> <p>For Enterprise POJOs, dealing with change is the most important issue. Changes will affect many system, and the systems might want to adopt these changes at different times. Simplicity, understandability, etc will have to be sacrificed in order to support change across multiple system.</p> <p>As enterprise systems are long lived, an important source of savings comes from identifying systems that can be taken out of commission and no longer maintained. The problem of many interoperating systems often means we need to introduce indirection layers.

It is so called because it organizes the interactions among applications in terms of stateful data rather than in terms of operations to be performed. Data structure and QoS are explicit and discoverable. The operations that act on that state are uniform1. As a result, the integration infrastructure is able to enforce the data structure and QoS contracts on behalf of the applications, such that applications are not permitted to communicate malformed data or to change data in inappropriate ways. Applications are easier to develop, less dependent on each other, and more fault-tolerant. Such architectures are therefore involving multiple teams.</p> <p>Example implementation technologies: SQL databases [4] (data at rest only), RESTful web services [6] (data at rest only), and OMG DDS [2] (data in motion).</p> <p>http://www.rti.com/whitepapers/System_Architecture_for_Integration.pdf</p> <p>Systems integration- the integration between applications. Principles:</p> <ul> <li>Achieve connection while at the same time maintaining the separation between applications.</li> <li>Decouple applications, so that each application knows nothing of the internal data, processing, technology or schedules of any other.</li> <li>Have well-defined system boundaries.</li> <li>Send data in lumps that are meaningful in business terms.</li> <li>Establish tool-independent standards for the technology and format of data sent between applications.</li> <li>Consider each application as an equal peer, rather than arranging applications in layers.</li> </ul> <p>http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/minimalit/principles-of-intraapplication-integration-38296</p> <p>Data-level At this level, backend data stores are integrated to enable the movement of data between them. Put simply, information can be extracted from one database, processed as needed, and then updating it in another database. In an EAI enterprise, this could mean drawing data from as many as hundreds of databases and thousands of tables. For this reason, keeping the integrated application's data intact is a problem. For example, one table might have dependencies to others, and the integrated application may be the sole enforcer of those dependencies. Data-level integration can be push- or pull-based. Push-based integration is when one application makes SQL queries on another application's database; data is pushed into another application's database. In contrast, pull-based integration is used when an application requires passive notification of changes within another application's data.</p> <p>Cost benefits of data-level integration give it its advantage over other approaches. This is because on the whole, the application is not altered; code is not changed and so the expense of changing, testing, and deploying the application is not incurred.</p> <p>Data-level integration should be used when the application up for integration does not provide any APIs or client interfaces. This is typically represented as the only option with custom applications lacking application APIs.</p> <p>Application-level This refers to making use of interfaces contained within custom or packaged applications such as SAP, Peoplesoft or Baan. These interfaces are leveraged to provide access to business processes and information. This approach is probably the best way to integrate applications as it allows you to invoke business logic to preserve data integrity. Developers are able to bundle many applications together so that business logic and information can be shared. This approach is more widely used and is preferred since it is transparent to the integrated application and the application's data integrity is preserved.</p> <p>Method-level In effect, this is a more complicated form of application-level integration and is used less frequently. Common operations on multiple applications are aggregated into a single front application. For example, the method for updating a customer record can be accessed from numerous applications without having to rewrite each method within the respective application. Since all applications that interact with the integrated applications do so via this front application, method-level integration requires the integrated applications to support a RPC (remote procedure call) or distributed component technology. The disadvantage lies in the fact that changing the integrated application API will break the front application components and the applications that rely on them. Given this then, it is usually more appropriate to opt for application-level integration using middleware.</p> <p>http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/ucacwxe/lectures/3C05-04-05/EAI-Essay.pdf</p>"},{"location":"EA/The-need-for-Enterprise-Pojos/","title":"The need for Enterprise Pojos","text":""},{"location":"EA/The-need-for-Enterprise-Pojos/#intro","title":"Intro","text":"<p>In this section, we are going to have a look at the drivers towards enterprise pojos.</p>"},{"location":"EA/The-need-for-Enterprise-Pojos/#terminology-and-definitions","title":"Terminology and definitions","text":""},{"location":"EA/The-need-for-Enterprise-Pojos/#enterprise","title":"Enterprise","text":"<p>Characteristics</p> <p>Definitions</p>"},{"location":"EA/The-need-for-Enterprise-Pojos/#enterprise-pojo","title":"Enterprise Pojo","text":"<p>Characteristics</p> <p>Definitions</p>"},{"location":"EA/The-need-for-Enterprise-Pojos/#key-questions","title":"Key questions:","text":"<ul> <li>How do systems and applications interact in today's enterprise</li> <li>What are the characteristics of the interactions</li> <li>What are the strengths, weaknesses and challenges today and looking forward</li> <li>What are the new interaction scenarios arriving at the enterprise arena?</li> <li>How the new interaction scenarios influence the technology options, and how are we to design an architecture which enable the new scenarios?</li> </ul> <p>This section will probably be a loosely moderated brainstorming session, where we will use some of the questions above to try and partition the requirement space for enterprise interaction, and try to define key features needed in enterprise architectures of today and tomorrow.</p>"},{"location":"EA/Understandability/","title":"Understandability","text":"<ul> <li>For whom?

Creating a Context Map of the separate systems within a solution is an clever solution. The Context Map enables the separate domains to co-exist, independently of the other domains, within each domain context. Each domain model is then separated by an anti-corruption adapters.</p> <p>Will the EDR pattern not enable (naive) developers to try to create an unified domain model, on top of other system, even if this is not always an good idea?</p> <p>A: Evans is very clear in his recommendation of creating Bounded Contexts. A Bounded Context might be a full system, or a subsystem. Every Bounded Context has its own domain model, with clear boundaries for what functionality that is included within the context. Every Bounded Context should not contain larger parts of a system than a small team can develop, and maintain.</p> <p>The Context Map describes how different Bounded Contexts relates to the other Bounded Contexts. Further Evans recommends that each Bounded Context will have its own set of services. These services that a Bounded Context offers relates to our Core Service. A service that consume functionality from other Core Services, is named Aggregated Core Service in our terminology.</p> <p>EDR must be implemented as an Core Service, accessing data directly from different back-end systems. Though possible, you should not attemt to use EDR as an Aggregated Core Service, where an Domain Object will be build from other services.</p> <p>EDR is an integrational pattern, where the goal is to build an Domain Object based on several data-sources. This Domain Object is served through a service. EDR must be defined within the boundaries of an Bouded Contex, with clear rules of what functionality is offered, and which functionality should not be offered.</p> <p>What is then achieved is that several Domain Models (or Bounded Contexts), are able to access the same data efficiently.</p> <p>As an EDR-service will stay within the borders of one Bounded Context, Eric Evan\u00b4s recommendations are not broken.</p>"},{"location":"EDR/FAQ/#how-does-the-provider-controller-support-the-correlator","title":"How does the Provider Controller support the Correlator?","text":"<p>Basically we have only made one implementation of the correlator until August 2007.

Typically they evolve to become the master repository for the most important business objects in the enterprise. Typical examples are Customer and Product. You will also find that it often makes sense to split a service for a domain object into a CRUD (master) service and a accompanying Query Service to keep the complexity to a manageable level, and to allow a more feature rich query interface. Page: ACS \u2014 Aggregated Core Services is extensions to [Core Services]. ACS is usually either context-specializing (CustomerCustomer and VendorCustomer) or aggregations from several [Core Services] like in CustomerDashboard which aggregates from Customer Service, Order Service and possibly more services Page: H2A \u2014 Human 2 Application Services is services involving key user interaction components with one or more humans to fulfill some activity/workflow.

Bruce; you have got a big part of this earlier so maybe a bit of a repeat for you. I will try to cut it short.</p> <p>You are all encouraged to comment on the topics, ideas and off cause add ideas to what we can do. But, no need to if you do not have the time or feel comfortable with the plan already</p> <p>Our intention during the weekend is to part by part build a true web application. The application we have in mind is a \"blog admin / input\" interface. The reason for selecting this as the topic is because it raises a field where a lot of the new parts in HTML5 solves old problems we have been struggling with for a long time. One example is for instence the possibility to store larger amount of data client side. In a blog input interface a browser crash can cause loss of what an author might have been writing in a blog input interface if he / she has not saved server side during writing. With client side storage we are now able to build web applications which can help us store typed input during writing and thereby be able to restore the data in case of a crash. Built in form validation will also save us a lot of the JavaScript pain we now are using to do input validation on the client. The list of benefits are long!</p> <p>We want to have short introductions to each topic we want to run trough. Then each group (5 persons in each group) will go and add a new piece to the application based on what they have been presented.</p> <p>Our idea are to build up the application in this order:</p> <p>1 - Talk - An overview of what we developers struggle with today  and how HTML5 can solve parts of those. 2 - Talk - A brief history lesion on why we have got HTML5. 3 - Talk - The new semantic elements (section, article, nav etc..). 4 - Coding - Build a framework for the application with the new semantic  elements. 5 - Talk - The new form elements, attributes and input validation. 6 - Coding - Append input elements with input validation to the application. 7 - Talk - Web Storage 8 - Coding - Append a feature which stores the content in each input  field in a Web Storage on each keystroke to prevent data loss. 9 - Talk - Web SQL 10 - Coding - Append a feature where the user can store and reopen written  content. 11 - Talk - Canvas 12 - Talk - The Drag and Drop API 13 - Coding - Append a feature where the user can drag an image from the  desktop into the application. Add a feature where canvas  are used to view the image (can include features to manipulate  the image and display the manipulated version in a canvas.  A third party library can be used for the manipulation). 14 - Talk - Video and Audio 15 - Coding - Add video and audio support to the upload feature with a preview. 16 - Talk - W3C Widgets 17 - Coding - Wrap the Web Application we have created into a W3C Widget for  distribution. 18 - Talk - How can we start to distribute our application today?</p> <p>The following topics are also topics we want to run trough but these can be dropped if we find the program to be too tight:</p> <p>19 - Talk - WebSockets 20 - Coding - Add support for live editing among two blog input interfaces  (require that we provide a server with websockets which can act  as a proxy). 21 - Talk - Online / offline detection 22 - Coding - Add support for online / offline detection. If offline prompt  user and start to store client side.</p> <p>We would also like to touch the topic of HTML5 and mobile but that might be to press too much into the weekend. Do note that this program is approximately spread out over 3 days. Point 1 will be on Friday as a warm up. Saturday can hold point 2 until point 15. Point 16 until 22 (++ if time) on Sunday.</p> <p>What do you think guys? Anything we are missing out on? Something we should leave out or exchange with something else?</p> <p>When it comes to who takes on what, it is already some parts which can be divided among us. Bruce are a real killer at all the markup stuff but, according to himself, not that hardcore on the JS stuff. I or Gregers will also hold a couple of talks.</p> <p>I suggest the following: Bruce holds: 2, 3, 5 and perhaps 14... Me / Gregers holds: 1, 16 and 18. I can also participate in 19.</p> <p>Dylan / Robert; what do you feel comfortable taking on?</p> <p>This mail is also stored in the Cantara wiki:  Does mail conversation suite you best for discussing this or are you guys OK registering in the Cantara wiki and let the discussion run there. If the later, please register, send me your username and I will give you access. NOTE: Everything we put in the Cantara wiki are under a Creative Commons 3.0 license and will be, after some editing and cleaning up, made public after the camp.</p> <p>A last note; we will also run a small and very \"unformal\" HTML5 hack competition! We have harvested a pile of Bruce's Introducing HTML5 book as prices to the winning team. We would like you guys to be in the jury for judging the hack's submitted.</p> <p>Trygve</p>"},{"location":"FRONT/Team-4/","title":"Team 4","text":"<ul> <li>Rikard Halvorsen</li> <li>Ivar Conradi \u00d8sthus</li> <li>Arve Systad</li> <li>Kris-Mikael Krister</li> <li> <p>Tor Martin</p> </li> <li> <p>Code repository</p> </li> <li> <p>Implementation</p> </li> <li> <p>Forms</p> </li> <li>Editor</li> <li>Websockets using hosted Hookbox</li> <li>Drag and Drop File Upload</li> <li>Canvas</li> </ul>"},{"location":"FRONT/Team-4/#code-repository","title":"Code repository","text":"<p>We are using Github as a repository for our code.

Furthermore, as a discipline we lack the mathematical tools and as humans we fall short of the intellectual capacity to model the behavior of ultralarge discrete systems.

Typical domain-objects might be:   - Customer - Contract - Product - Order    You need to create a service with several components, each responsible for a single task. The tasks are: - Domain object composition. - Domain object caching. - Data retrieval and update from a single back-end system. - Key management. Impacts The addition of the different components introduces design and development effort and using the resulting service may lead to performance overhead. Principles Service Composability,Service Loose Coupling, Service Abstraction (all from Erl)  Use Enterprise Domain Repository to build a single Domain Object as a Core Service. Enterprise Domain Repository should not be used to map several domain objects into a single domain object. An Aggregated Core Service is the appropriate solution for this kind of mapping. (principles from Objectware Community)  An example illustrating this if if you have a Product domain object, created from two provider objects ShipProduct and ShipProductDescriptions. Architecture Service, The Enterprise Domain Repository Pattern provides a clear separation of concerns between system specific integration complexity, Key Correlation between systems, repository management, field mapping and merging strategies.

To achieve this the repository must maintain control of the objects and the providers that supply the data that constructs them.

Domain Object Domain Object holds data and business functionallity. In this context the Domain Object will hold data that resides in different core systems. The Domain Object can be serialized, and then passed on to the client. This approach enables the client to perform operating on the actual Domain Object.</p> <p>Correlator</p> <p>The Repository Controller must support Key correlation between Providers used by the EDR. This is vital in order to construct Domain Objects from multiple Provider Objects. The Key correlation mechanism may be an internal implementation or an external package designed for this purpose.</p> <p>Repository</p> <p>The Repository is responsible for storing the Domain Objects in a persistent or non-persistent store. This store may be an in-memory cache, a file/xml-based persistence or a database. In many cases it can prove useful to have a persistent store which will give opportunities for scaling and better performance. Provider Pattern</p> <p>The Provider pattern is used to abstract communication with underlying systems. The providers should be focused and specialized on delivering only the required Provider Objects required by the Repository Controller to construct the Domain Objects. The main responsibility of the Provider is to deliver Provider Objects from one and only one source system to the Repository Controller in a coherent manner and abstract all complexity of the underlying system to the Repository Controller. Provider Object</p> <p>The Provider Object is a representation identical to, or tightly coupled to the semantics of the underlying system. In many cases it may be reasonable to implement the Provider Object using the Aggregate pattern in order to hide unnecessary complexity from the underlying system towards the Repository Controller.</p> <p>We recomend that the Provider Object has two different keys. Provider Key is the same Key the one found in the Core system. The second Key, Logical Provider Key is created by the Correlator.</p> <p>To fully support data updates one of three strategies must be selected:</p> <ul> <li>All updates, from all clients must pass through this service.</li> <li>The service must receive update notification events from the back-ends.</li> <li>Short lifetime of cached objects.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"KM/Enterprise-Domain-Repository/#related-patterns","title":"Related patterns","text":"<ul> <li>Entity abstraction</li> </ul>"},{"location":"KM/Enterprise-Domain-Repository/#extensions","title":"Extensions","text":"<p>This pattern may be combined with the Evolving Service Endpoint Pattern to construct a complete service for distributed exposure.</p>"},{"location":"KM/Enterprise-Domain-Repository/#attribution","title":"Attribution","text":"<ul> <li>Objectware Community Wiki (wiki.community.objectware.no)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"KM/Functional-requirement-template/","title":"Functional requirement template","text":""},{"location":"KM/Functional-requirement-template/#functional-requirements","title":"Functional requirements","text":"<p>|  | - Good requirements meet a specific need - Good requirements are verifiable - Good requirements are attainable - Good requirements are clear |</p> <p>Template (As from Gilb)</p> <ul> <li>Stakeholders:  <li>Scale:  <li>Meter:  <li>Past </li> <li>Goal  <p>Norsk eksempel</p> <ul> <li>Interessent:</li> <li>M\u00e5leverkt\u00f8y:</li> <li>M\u00e5lemetode:</li> <li>F\u00f8r:</li> <li>M\u00e5l:</li> </ul>"},{"location":"KM/Functional-requirement-template/#requirement-organization","title":"Requirement organization","text":"<ul> <li>Level 1 - main functional areas (as seen from the system users)</li> <li>Level 2 - user tasks for each functional area<ul> <li>Level 3 - alternate flows</li> </ul> </li> <li>Level 1 - administrative functional areas</li> <li>Level 2 - administrative tasks<ul> <li>Level 3 - alternate flows</li> </ul> </li> <li>Level 1 - other</li> </ul>"},{"location":"KM/Functional-requirement-template/#prioritization-template","title":"Prioritization template","text":"Feature Total Value Relative Cost Relative Risk Priority"},{"location":"KM/H2A/","title":"H2A","text":""},{"location":"KM/H2A/#human-2-application-services","title":"Human 2 Application Services","text":"<p>|  | Human 2 Application Services Human 2 Application Services is an implementation of a use-case/user story  - which implements one, and only one human actor |</p> Characteristics Workflow-oriented Services which require human interaction   - Long running transactions - Most services start as H2A Services - Automated on a ROI basis - Non-trivial decisions points that require 'human touch' - Starting-point/front-end of externalized processes  Patterns for Human 2 Application Services  --- Human 2 Application Services"},{"location":"KM/H2A/#design-rules","title":"Design rules","text":"P1.

The product champion is required to have a deep and solid domain knowledge and will often play the role of a customer proxy in the project.

At any time, the chief engineer should be able and willing to stand up to proudly describe the solution and explain how everything fits together. He/she should be responsible for technological decisions but also make sure that the solution is supporting the business strategy. The chief engineer is the main communication channel between this project and other projects.

The project manager is the main interface between the project and corporate management.

It attempts to simulate how a team can work together towards a common goal.</p> <p>The game players are divided into pairs. Each pair sits at one workstation. A single exercise will be handed out. Everyone will work on this exercise at their workstation, through a number of iterations.</p> <p>For each iteration there will be a goal given by the Game Master. Between iterations there will be a retrospective where the team can reflect over the previous iteration and find strategies for the next iteration.</p> <p>During an iteration, a small bell will ring roughly every two minutes to indicate a swap of keyboard driver. A louder horn is used to indicate that the iteration will soon end. Each pair should then try to get all their tests passing (go GREEN). When all tests are passing write down the time it took to get to green (this will be projected on a wall) together with the number of running tests on the workstation timesheet. Then hand the timesheet to the Game Master and cover your workstation with the green cover. The Game Master will gather statistics and present them for all the players. A short retrospective then takes place. A goal for the next iteration is decided (which can be a repeat of the same goal - repetition is an important part of practice).

There are in fact one key similarity between OW SOA (unlike most other SOA strategies) and REST, and that is that OW SOA puts resources/business data as first class citizens of the architecture (ACS and CS category services) which mimics the resource-oriented architecture of most successful REST approaches. Other than that, REST is mainly an architectural style where OW SOA is an architecture, so a feature-by-feature comparison does not provide much value.</p> <p>REST is an architectural style which has 4 fundamental constraints:</p> <ol> <li>Identification of resources</li> <li>Manipulation of resources through representations</li> <li>Self-descriptive messages</li> <li>Hypermedia as the engine of application state</li> </ol> <p>Our question is: Can we design a system using OW SOA architectural rules and conforming to REST architectural constraints. This question can be answered by looking at how each REST constraint is supported by OW SOA.</p> REST constraint Applicable to OW SOA Comment 1. Identification of resources All OW SOA services can be identified/ID 2. Manipulation of resources through representations OW SOA manifests the each service should be able to support multiple interfaces (ESE and the like) 3. Self-descriptive messages Just implementation details of the service endpoint 4. Hypermedia as the engine of application state Implementation detail, but OW SOA services should be reusable/building blocks which means that coupling to clients workflows must be minimal. Services with hypermedia workflow suggestions are best suited for H2A services in OW SOA <p>The fourth REST architectural constraint is obviously conflicting with OW SOA architectural rules. Actually it conflicts with all SOA approaches because of the general mismatch between SOA and REST mindsets. Reusablity of services is one of the main SOA requirements. It allows the composition of services to create new services and this is a good thing. It also allows the clients to create new workflows of services and the number of these workflows is potentially unlimited. Thus, a well designed SOA framework can grow very easy both in the number of services and the number of clients.</p> <p>The RESTful services are workflows themselves. After each invocation they tell the client what to do next. Each client may want to have each own workflow and that requirement constraints the degree of service reuse. This means that reusability can not be a goal of the RESTful services. (This also raises some discussions of separation of workflow responsibility between the REST services and the clients of the REST services which have yet to been defined clearly within the REST community.)</p> <p>Another way to look at this is by the following anology: static vs. dynamic view of the system. SOA is focused on the static view of the system. It defines where the data/functionality can be found and is not very concerned about the data movement. REST provides the dynamic view of the system. Its main focus is the movement of data across the system.</p> <p>These differences between SOA and REST don't mean that OW SOA and REST are completely incompatible. Instead, they are complementary. RESTful services can be built on top of SOA services and act as client-aware proxies to SOA services. This will work very well with OW SOA because OW SOA fully supports the three first fundamental REST constraints.</p> <p>Note REST-style endpoints are excellent candidates for endpoints in OW SOA, both self standing and as complementary endpoints to WS-* endpoints and other protocols.</p>"},{"location":"OWSOA/Human-2-Application-Services/","title":"Human 2 Application Services","text":""},{"location":"OWSOA/Human-2-Application-Services/#human-2-application-services_1","title":"Human 2 Application Services","text":"Human 2 Application Services Human 2 Application Services is services involving key user interaction components with one or more humans to fulfill some activity/workflow.

The customer changed his billing address immediately, but did not receive a bill for several months. One day, the customer received a threatening phone call from the credit-card billing department, asking why the bill has not been paid. The customer verifies that they have the new address, and the billing department verifies that the address on file is 1001 11th St. N. The customer asks for a copy of the bill, to settle the account. After two more weeks without a bill, the customer calls back and finds the account has been turned over to a collection agency. This time, they find out that even though the address in the file was 1001 11th St. N, the billing address is 101 11th St. N. After a bunch of phone calls and letters between lawyers, the bill finally gets resolved and the credit-card company has lost a customer for life. In this case, the master copy of the data was accurate, but another copy of it was flawed. Master data must be both correct and consistent.

Responsen var god og i august 2001 ble det etablert en web-site, www.nnug.no.  Det f\u00f8rste m\u00f8tet ble arrangert 30. oktober 2001 i Oslo. Invitasjon gikk ut til alle som da hadde registrert seg p\u00e5 NNUG og via Microsofts MSDN mailliste. 60 personer m\u00f8tte. Det var tre faglige presentasjoner av personer som har jobbet med .NET. Etter den faglige delen var det en plenumsdiskusjon om hva .NET skal gj\u00f8re. F\u00f8lgende kom da bl.a. opp:  Pub-kvelder  Lukkede diskusjonsgrupper p\u00e5 websiten  Sette sammen et styre for NNUG  Flere brukergruppem\u00f8ter   Alle som var interessert i \u00e5 v\u00e6re med \u00e5 drive NNUG videre ble invitert til \u00e5 melde seg. 4 personer gjorde dette og det ble etablert et styre for NNUG.

The transition to XAML-based user interfaces is underway, and most developers are still using UI design principles from the 1990s. With new degrees of freedom, it's time to throw away obsolete conventions and find new ways to make users productive and happy. That means getting back to the basics on fundamental principles of user interface design. In this session, we'll do a ground-zero discussion of the design principles around animation, spatial arrangements, interaction patterns, colors, fonts, and more. To explain these design processes in a more concrete manner, the approach will depend heavily on how the user's brain wiring helps us understand the way to think about design.

Oslo.pm (Perl utvikling) [Practical Tips for Rakudo Star]  Perl 6 has been under development for many years. \"Rakudo\" is the Perl 6 implementation on top of the Parrot virtual machine, and it about to have its first release defined as \"usable\" by its main developers. This release is called Rakudo * (Star).  In this talk Rune will show you how to get hold of Rakudo, tell you ways Perl 6 will be quicker to program in than Perl 5 and other languages, and give an idea on how it can help you avoid bugs in your code.  Speaker: Karl Rune Nilsen  Talk language: Norwegian  Rune has used Perl for very large web systems since 1996. Rune enjoys reducing the complexity and bugcounts of large systems by applying principles of functional languages, following the development of Rakudo Perl, cold beer and long walks on the beach. He currently works as a consultant at Redpill Linpro AS.   ---   [Perl - a bit like Ruby, but with a usable object system]  Ruby first came to my attention as a neat little language that attempted to put lisp, Perl, and smalltalk in a bag and shake - and ended up with a rather beautiful result.  Since then, the state of the art of Perl 5 OO has come on in leaps and bounds - drawing inspiration from ruby, rakudo, CLOS and ML among others in the process.  And now every time I look at ruby again I try and find the equivalent metaprogramming and re-use capabilities and ... they aren't there. I keep thinking \"is this it?\" - I'm reminded of meeting PHP4 and wondering where the hell the closures were.  So in this talk I'm going to give you a guided tour of the Moose meta OO syntax extension system and its associated metaprotocol, and the nearest equivalents I've been able to find in ruby.  Hopefully those who value OO and metaprogramming over language choice will take another look at Perl, those who're scared of $ signs will consider wholesale theft of ideas in the grandest traditions of open source, and those who know better than me will heckle and tell me what I got wrong.  And most importantly, hopefully we'll have fun learning something new about OO together  Speaker: Matt S. Trout  Talk language: English  Matt is a co-maintainer of the Catalyst web framework, the creator of the DBIx::Class ORM, a core team member for the Moose project, and contributor to several other CPAN projects. He's a frequent speaker at conferences, and well known in the Perl community for his colourful presentations.

Det siste \u00e5ret har han jobbet med en masteroppgave sentrert rundt alternative JVM-spr\u00e5k som Scala, Clojure og (J)Ruby.   ---   [Simple Build Tool]  Simple Build Tool er et byggeverkt\u00f8y for Scala, skrevet i Scala, der  du ogs\u00e5 skriver Scala for \u00e5 definere byggen din. Foredaget vil  introdusere sbt og demonstrere hvordan du enkelt h\u00e5ndterer  kompilering, pakking, testing, plugins og mer.  Speaker: Jon Anders Teigen Jon-Anders Teigen jobber til daglig i Arktekk som Java utvikler, men har kost seg med Scala i snart 3 \u00e5r. Han har bidratt til flere opensource scala prosjekter og er en av grunnleggerne av scalaBin NNUG (Norwegian .NET user Group) [Energimerkesystem for NVE (energimerking.no)]  Speaker: Shiraz Bhaiji Shiraz jobber i Avenir.   ---   [Ordrebehandlingssystem for Reinertsen byggherre]  ASP.NET MVC, jQuery, NHibernate  Speaker: Adis Delalic Adis jobber i Avenir.   ---   [Using workflow rule engine in plain .NET applications]  Speaker: Vagif Abilov Vagif jobber i Miles. Oslo XP-meetup (Smidig utvikling) Teknisk gjeld i smidige prosjekter  Smidige prosjekter risikerer \u00e5 fremelske progresjon og utvikling av funksjonalitet, og miste kontroll over sin tekniske gjeld. Produkeier, prosjektleder og scrum master kan alle ha incentiver til \u00e5 levere s\u00e5 mye som mulig p\u00e5 s\u00e5 kort tid som mulig - men uten tilstrekkelig kvalitet. Denne lyntalen fors\u00f8ker \u00e5 synliggj\u00f8re at medaljen har en bakside, og at det er ekstremt viktig \u00e5 ha noen i prosjektet som kan forvalte den tekniske gjelden.  Speaker: Harald S\u00f8vik Harald jobber som teknisk prosjektleder og fagleder java i Computas.   ---   [Doomed project? Not so fast!]  Many software projects fail to achieve their goals. Based on past experiences, Jerome will look at factors that enable (or not) you to save projects from disasters.  Speaker: Jerome Lacoste   ---   [Back-to-the-future: Extreme Programming]  Ta en tidsreise tilbake f\u00f8r \"agile\" het \"agile\". Det er over ti \u00e5r siden Extreme Programming f\u00f8rst ble lansert. I motsetning til moderne \"touchy-feely\" metoder som Scrum, besto XP for ti \u00e5r siden av 12 teknikker som man m\u00e5tte bruke p\u00e5 prosjektet for \u00e5 kunne kalle det et Extreme Programming prosjekt. For ti \u00e5r siden var disse teknikkene ambisi\u00f8se for prosjekter. I dag er de realistiske for mange \u00e5 innf\u00f8re. Og man kan oppn\u00e5 en kjempeeffekt av \u00e5 innf\u00f8re dem. Johannes snakker i dette foredraget om verdiene som ga grunnlaget for Extreme Programming og hvordan de 12 teknikkene i den originale beskrivelsen av Extreme Programming hjelper ham p\u00e5 prosjekter den dag i dag.  Speaker: Johannes Brodwall Johannes er chief scientist i Steria. Han tar et helhetsperspektiv i sine prosjekter for \u00e5 forst\u00e5 hvordan et sammensatt bilde av teknologier og fagomr\u00e5der skaper verdi for brukerne av systemet. Johannes organiserer aktiviteter i det fagmilj\u00f8et rundt Smidige metoder i Oslo. Hans mest tidkrevende fritidsinteresser er arrangeringen av Oslo XP meetup og den \u00e5rlige Smidig-konferansen. Han er en gjenganger som foredragsholder i Java- og Smidig-fagmilj\u00f8er i Oslo og skriver ogs\u00e5 om utvikling p\u00e5 sin blog p\u00e5 http://johannesbrodwall.com   ---   [Boost Scrum med Lean tankegang]  Scrum er et maksimalt enkelt rammeverk - og mange lar seg lett forf\u00f8re; Det kan se ut som en slags oppskrift som bare er \u00e5 f\u00f8lge, uten \u00e5 gj\u00f8re s\u00e5 mange selvstendige vurderinger underveis. Dette er veldig farlig og antagelig hoved\u00e5rsaken til at alt for mange organisasjoner sliter med \u00e5 ta ut gevinsten av Scrum.  Om man benytter Lean tankegangen kombinert med Scrum \u00f8ker sjansene for \u00e5 lykkes betraktelig. Lean er b\u00e5de et tankesett og en rekke nyttige verkt\u00f8y.   Eksempler:   - \"Pull\" - ta alltid utgangspunkt i kundens behov og lever sm\u00e5 drypp av verdi - i siste liten. - \"Eliminate waste\" - analyser flyten i systemet og jobb systematisk med \u00e5 identifisere og fjerne flaskehalser, k\u00f8er, feilretting og annen sl\u00f8sing - \"Relentless Improvement\" - utnytt korte iterasjoner og hyppige leveranser til \u00e5 stadig bli bedre  - Eksempler p\u00e5 verkt\u00f8y: Value Stream Mapping, Kanban, \"5 whys\", A3   Speaker: Geir Amsj\u00f8 Geir er Norges eneste sertifiserte Scrum Trainer, og har mer enn 20 \u00e5rs erfaring fra produktutvikling innen IT-bransjen i mange ulike roller. De siste 10 \u00e5rene har han jobbet som konsulent innen prosessforbedring med hovedfokus p\u00e5 innf\u00f8ring av Scrum og Lean. Geir har holdt noen titalls Certified Scrum Master kurs og er en anerkjent foredrags- og kursholder i IT-milj\u00f8et i Norge.   ---   [Hvordan utnytte programvarekompleksitet til din fordel]  Vi opplevde for h\u00f8y feilrate grunnet for h\u00f8y kompleksitet i en av releasene v\u00e5re. Dette fikk oss til \u00e5 ta grep for \u00e5 redusere kompleksiteten og dermed ogs\u00e5 feilraten og Time To Market. Lyntalen beskriver problemet og l\u00f8sningen vi innf\u00f8rte for \u00e5 hjelpe p\u00e5 dette.  Speaker: Vidar Moe Vidar har mange \u00e5rs erfaring fra systemutviklingsprosjekter hos Norges st\u00f8rste kunder, n\u00e5 senest SpareBank 1. Hans hovedinteresser er programvarekvalitet, smidig utviklingsmetodikk og arkitektur. Vidar er ogs\u00e5 en ivrig lean-evangelist.

Vi ser for oss et ca 1000 kvm stort lokale med plass til medlemsm\u00f8ter opp til ca 150 personer, mingleomr\u00e5de, servering og gode prosjektrom. Vi har f\u00e5tt mange signaler og \u00f8nsker om et slikt sted, b\u00e5de for \u00e5 gj\u00f8re det enklere for folk \u00e5 arrangere medlemsm\u00f8ter og andre eventer, men ogs\u00e5 som et samlingspunkt for engasjerte fagfolk, enten de \u00f8nsker \u00e5 diskutere teknologi og fag, eller jobbe sammen med forskjellige open-source prosjekter eller andre fagaktiviteter. Lokalet skal v\u00e6re gratis for brukerorganisasjoner.  Vi har allerede igangsatt arbeidet, og har allerede sett p\u00e5 endel lokaler og avtalt m\u00f8te med Olav Thon. Vi er klar over at andre milj\u00f8 jobber med lignende initiativer, og vi h\u00e5per at vi kan samles om et felles prosjekt.  For \u00e5 sikre at utviklerhuset blir den suksessen vi h\u00e5per p\u00e5, s\u00e5 \u00f8nsker vi \u00e5 invitere dere med i den uformelle arbeidsgruppen som jobber med krav, design og operasjonalisering av utviklerhuset og som aktivt prioriterer muligheter opp mot hverandre der vi ikke klarer \u00e5 f\u00e5 \"i pose og sekk\".  Arbeidet vil foreg\u00e5 hovedsaklig on-line, via en felles prosjektwiki, men vi ser ogs\u00e5 for oss \u00e5 ha bi-ukentlige samlinger for \u00e5 holde aktivitetsniv\u00e5et og forankringen oppe.  Er dette noe for deg/dere, s\u00e5 send oss en mail p\u00e5 styret@cantara.no, s\u00e5 gir vi deg tilgang til prosjektwikien og inviterer deg/dere til oppstartsm\u00f8tet i arbeidsgruppen.

Pattern library - these patterns should be available in both code and document forms and will provide users with solutions to common (and hopefully more advanced) issues.  2. Openly available implementations of various services, tools and frameworks - developed and refined over time, based on the experience of people using them in anger.  3. Deployment examples - reference information concerning the ways in which JavaSpaces and JINI technologies have been applied in the real world. These will be useful to both architects and administrators.  We believe that the best way to achieve the above is in an open, co-operative manner thus Blitz is an OpenSource project. Until recently, SUN's approach to JINI licensing made things difficult, but JINI is now licensed under ALv2.

But when the company doesn't sincerely accept the change in work style, the result is just a buzzword for the usual project hell, as Charlie Martin's story about an agile project gone wrong describes:</p> <p>Sometimes, your friends tell you hard things. If you think you're doing Agile, you must step back every so often and ask: Can I respond to changing requirements easily? Do I have confidence that I could run the current build and see part of the system work? Am I seeing my family on a regular basis? Or did we plan to work overtime over Christmas to make our commitments? If you aren't seeing easy response to change, regular working deliveries and a regular schedule with a normal workweek, you have a cargo cult...</p> <p>Cargo cults developed in Melanesia, starting in the 19th century, but really grew during World War II. To the locals, the war meant cargo planes and cargo ships arriving, carrying everything from canned pineapple to Quonset huts. And it was good... Then the war ended, and the cargo stopped. The locals responded by building their own runways, with airplanes made of bamboo and palm fronds, in hopes of attracting it back.</p> <p>Martin's experience relates to a project that wanted to follow agile principles, but also had to fit into existing corporate standards and processes. Some agile principles were compromised, and although the project did deliver, it was late, cost more than anticipated, and was not much different in the end from a traditional waterfall project.</p>"},{"location":"dev/Cargo-Cult/#what-does-a-cargo-cult-agile-shop-look-like-1","title":"What does a cargo cult agile shop look like? [1]","text":"<p>From the outside, it may look a lot like an actual agile shop. After all, a cargo cult shop is imitating what they have seen about agile. However, like waterfall proponents, cargo cult agile shops are led by people who have looked at pictures of agile models, \"read\" agile books, or \"learned\" agile development from PowerPoint presentations. Perhaps there are a number of developers who know agile, but they may not be able to move the company towards agility in the face of generations of managers and developers who have been indoctrinated by DoD-2167.</p> <p>By definition, agility describes an ability to respond to changes. As such, any agile process is going to have some sort of iterative process in which the software is improved and responds to any changes that have occurred during development. In a cargo cult shop, keep a particular eye out for iterations that don't include tasks other than programming. If the details of analysis, design, and testing are excluded, you are probably looking at a \"cowboy\" project or a waterfall project in disguise. An iteration should always include or consider changes. While possible, it is unlikely that the project will remain completely unchanged after an iteration.</p> <p>With any agile process, the speed and effectiveness of adapting to change is the primary measure of how agile your team has become. If you are using an effective agile process, responding to change should be graceful. If a change causes a lot of disruption, or re-visiting a line of code that someone has already typed causes alarms to go off, you may be in a cargo cult.</p> <p>If you are looking at a potential agile company, look at their process in as much detail as they will allow during the interview. If they use XP, ask to look at story cards. Do their unit tests actually test the functionality, or are they a check box to get past a sign-off? Are the story cards simply a requirements document created in one big design up front or do they add, change, and remove cards as they get further into the project. On a scrum project, ask how long a typical scrum meeting lasts. If their idea of a daily scrum is two hours, run, don't walk, to your next interview because they have missed the point entirely.</p> <p>If you are already in a cargo cult agile shop challenge your process. Good agile process encourages a constant feedback loop regarding both your product and your process. If an agile process isn't working look into why and fix it. Go past the powerpoint presentations and the diagrams. Reproduce the results that created the processes you are attempting to emulate. If the agile process is printed and bound, and they haven't made a single change to it in five years, it is highly likely they have not challenged and enhanced their process to fit their people.</p> <p>Some agile models are a toolkit and give guidance on how to effectively use them, while other methodologies require practices to be used together to achieve a result. Some practices stand on their own while others may be interdependent. Understand the benefits and consequences of cherry picking from agile, especially if you are doing a project waterfall style.</p>"},{"location":"dev/Cargo-Cult/#agile-as-a-cult-1","title":"Agile as a Cult [1]","text":"<p>I am a fan of agile development in general because the Agile movement formally questioned and rejected the dogma of how software development should be done and, in particular, challenged the continuously failing waterfall model.

F\u00f8rst av alt vil jeg takke dere for at dere st\u00f8ttet Smidig 2009 som sponsor. For tredje \u00e5ret p\u00e5 rad ble fjor\u00e5rets Smidig-konferanse en s\u00e6rdeles vellykket begivenhet. N\u00e6rmere 500 deltakere fikk to l\u00e6rerike dager med lyntaler og open space-diskusjoner. Lyntalene ble filmet og gjort fritt tilgjengelig for alle p\u00e5 http://tcs.java.no/. Nettsidene for fjor\u00e5rets konferanse finner man p\u00e5 http://smidig2009.no/.</p> <p>Konferansen ble i 2009 avholdt i Oslo Kongressenter. P\u00e5 grunn av \u00f8nsket om \u00e5 kunne vokse litt, har vi i \u00e5r besluttet \u00e5 flytte til Radisson Blu Scandinavia Hotel. Vi vil i stor grad f\u00f8lge tidligere \u00e5rs format og konsepter, og vil i \u00e5r ogs\u00e5 vurdere \u00e5 inkludere noen kjente navn. Vi satser p\u00e5 \u00e5 \u00f8ke antallet deltagere litt fra ifjor. Informasjon om konferansen blir \u00e5 finne p\u00e5 http://smidig2010.no/.</p> <p>Som tidligere arrangeres konferansen av frivillige entusiaster, og finansieres av deltageravgift og sponsormidler fra firmaer som \u00f8nsker \u00f8kt fokus p\u00e5 smidige metoder. I dagens markedssituasjon synes fokuset p\u00e5 smidig systemvikling \u00e5 v\u00e6re enda viktigere enn tidligere. Som sponsor for Smidig 2010 viser dere at dere satser p\u00e5 metoder som gir kostnadseffektivitet og god kvalitet. Tidligere konferanser har hatt mange deltagere fra viktige kunder som NRK, NAV, BBS, DnB NOR, Statens Pensjonskasse og Finn.no.</p> <p>Tidligere har vi sagt at det er viktig \u00e5 understreke at smidige metoder ikke er \u00e9n enkelt bedrifts kommersialiserte tanker og ideer, men derimot tankegodset til en hel bevegelse innenfor IT. Dette er ogs\u00e5 utgangspunktet for Smidig 2010. Vi \u00f8nsker at konferansen skal forbli et spleiselag, hvor alle sponsorer blir tilegnet like mye plass og oppmerksomhet. \u00c5 v\u00e6re sponsor for Smidig 2010 er et sterkt signal om at dere stiller seg bak bevegelsen for smidige metoder og st\u00f8tter opp under det frivillige initiativet som er drivkraften bak arrangement. Alle sponsormidlene g\u00e5r direkte inn i konferansens drift.</p> <p>Sponsorene g\u00e5r inn med kroner 25 000,- hver og f\u00e5r for dette f\u00f8lgende:</p> <ul> <li>Bedriftens logo p\u00e5 konferansens hjemmeside</li> <li>Bedriftens logo p\u00e5 alle trykksaker til konferansen (plakater, flyveblader, program)</li> <li>Bedriftens logo p\u00e5 eventuell annonsering, for eksempel i Computerworld</li> <li>Hederlig omtale i konferansens \u00e5pningstale</li> <li>Rett til \u00e5 benytte Smidig 2010 i bedriftens markedsf\u00f8ring</li> <li>To deltakerbilletter til konferansen</li> <li>Mulighet til \u00e5 ha en pullup i fellesrom under konferanse</li> <li>Mulighet til \u00e5 gj\u00f8re ett A4-ark med informasjon om bedriften tilgjengelig for alle deltakerne under konferansen</li> </ul> <p>Dersom dere \u00f8nsker \u00e5 sponse konferansen, trenger vi en fakturaadresse og to logoer.

The Java community has a comprehensive suite of tools to choose from; IDE, VCS, build tools, CI server and Build Artifact Repository Manager. It is common (perhaps even best practice?) to standardize on VCS and build tool on Enterprise Java projects. While it might be appropriate to standardize on IDE in a small (not Enterprise) project, this is seldom a good idea (reasoning: three competing IDEs, \"works-here-syndrome\", etc.). As of time of writing Maven2 is the leading build tool on the market and Subversion  is the most popular VCS.  For repository management, the choice is not that obvious as there are at least three adequate products available; Archiva, Artifactory and Nexus. Archiva has no support for virtual repositories, so Artifactory seems a better choice for most big companies. Nexus claims to have both virtual repository support and use file system storage (not a Java space like Artifactory) and surfs up as an enticing alternative to the two others. The recommendations given is based on experiences from using Artifactory, but most should apply to both Nexus and Archiva.

That is, all modules have the same release cycle and they share configuration from the Parent POM. The relationship between the POMs are thus that the modules are referenced from the parent with the module element AND the modules reference the parent with the parent element. So what is the purpose of this project setup?</p> <p>Like any modularization concept the module makes it easier to adhere to the principle of high cohesion, low coupling . With Java packages an import is required to use code from another package. With Maven modules it is necessary to explicitly add a dependency to the other module to be able to use code from it, just like a dependency to any other Maven artifact. This makes the coupling between modules explicit, and the build will break if you create circular dependencies.</p> <p>A additional - positive - side-effect is that modules make it easier to identify code blocks that can be reused. Code that should be shared between projects with different release cycles need to be refactoring into a standalone Maven project, and it is easier to set up a separate project if the code is located in a cohesive module. See more reasons in the FAQ .</p> <p>|  | A word of caution Be wary of over-engineering by creating too many modules. Code with good structure is easier to re-use, but sometimes re-use is not on the agenda (YAGNI). Remember also that trying to enforce larger moves can result in project friction. You should always take into account the culture and skill set of your project team. Educate your team on how and why modularization is done. |</p> <p>That be said, it is more common to have too few modules than too many.

It should also have a variable workload component that magnifies the savings of the architectural properties above.</p> <p>Strange then that many a developer expects to move their existing application, full of enterprise DNA (static configuration, vertical clusters, no horizontal scaling, high administration costs) to such an offering with minimal change. They even complain when it proves difficult because all those \"enterprise features\" aren't present. Why does this happen?</p> <p>I believe it's because these developers have fundamentally misunderstood how cloud computing delivers its benefits. They see the cheap prices but don't stop to consider where the cost saving comes from. Some of it is achieved by cloud platform vendors getting large discounts on huge hardware orders but a significant proportion comes from the fact that they don't need to provide (via human resources or APIs) the sysadmin functions required for conventional hosting solutions.</p> <p>Quite simply typical applications, their architectures and associated administration practices are not setup for cloud platforms. Some of them may be able to run on these platforms with sufficient hackery, brute force and associated cost. However if the motivation for a move to the cloud is merely to reduce kit costs one might well be better off looking for a cheaper conventional hosting solution.</p> <p>In summary, making the best of the cloud requires that we take an architectural view, something that we've proven remarkably bad at over and over.

The interfaces hide the implementation details and enable a completely automated response by the provider of the service to the consumer of the service. The service could be considered \"ready to use\" or \"off the shelf\" because the service is designed to serve the specific needs of a set of consumers, and the technologies are tailored to that need rather than the service being tailored to how the technology works. The articulation of the service feature is based on service levels and IT outcomes (availability, response time, performance versus price, and clear and predefined operational processes), rather than technology and its capabilities. In other words, what the service needs to do is more important than how the technologies are used to implement the solution.</p> <p>Scalable and Elastic: The service can scale capacity up or down as the consumer demands at the speed of full automation (which may be seconds for some services and hours for others). Elasticity is a trait of shared pools of resources. Scalability is a feature of the underlying infrastructure and software platforms. Elasticity is associated with not only scale but also an economic model that enables scaling in both directions in an automated fashion. This means that services scale on demand to add or remove resources as needed.</p> <p>Shared: Services share a pool of resources to build economies of scale. IT resources are used with maximum efficiency. The underlying infrastructure, software or platforms are shared among the consumers of the service (usually unknown to the consumers). This enables unused resources to serve multiple needs for multiple consumers, all working at the same time.</p> <p>Metered by Use: Services are tracked with usage metrics to enable multiple payment models. The service provider has a usage accounting model for measuring the use of the services, which could then be used to create different pricing plans and models. These may include pay-as-you go plans, subscriptions, fixed plans and even free plans. The implied payment plans will be based on usage, not on the cost of the equipment. These plans are based on the amount of the service used by the consumers, which may be in terms of hours, data transfers or other use-based attributes delivered.</p> <p>Uses Internet Technologies: The service is delivered using Internet identifiers, formats and protocols, such as URLs, HTTP, IP and representational state transfer Web-oriented architecture. Many examples of Web technology exist as the foundation for Internet-based services. Google's Gmail, Amazon.com's book buying, eBay's auctions and Lolcats' picture sharing all exhibit the use of Internet and Web technologies and protocols.</p>"},{"location":"~totto/2009_09_/","title":"Thor Henning Hetland Blog from September, 2009","text":"<p>I've had some discussions on the greenness of Cloud Computing the last few weeks.
