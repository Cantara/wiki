The longer the release cycle the bigger the risk of partial or complete failure. The product owner should actively work towards reducing the length of releases. It will not always be possible to release every three months but it should always be the goal a project strives after.

Today\u00b4s taxonomy strategies have struggled hard to provide positive return of investment (ROI). Projects experience frequently that their taxonomy changes and they have to keep re-investing in their taxonomy and categorization.  We believe that since the internet search engines started to rule the world, we need to rethink they way we look at information and categorization. With the new and up-coming auto-categorization services, we see a potential of shifting the effort from people to machines in taxonomy and categorization in the same way that the serach engines shifted the information gathering from catalogs to search.

Most objects of will be private to one application. But the objects that are shared between two applications and the objects that are shared across a large number of applications in the enterprise must be treated differently. The fact that more systems depend on the same objects means we have to deal with a lot more problems. \"Enterprise POJOs\" is a term we use to discuss these issues. An \"Enterprise POJO\" is an object that is being used by (many systems? more than one system?) in the enterprise.</p> <p>For Enterprise POJOs, dealing with change is the most important issue. Changes will affect many system, and the systems might want to adopt these changes at different times. Simplicity, understandability, etc will have to be sacrificed in order to support change across multiple system.</p> <p>As enterprise systems are long lived, an important source of savings comes from identifying systems that can be taken out of commission and no longer maintained. The problem of many interoperating systems often means we need to introduce indirection layers. However, each layer of indirection will make it harder to identified information that is no longer needed.</p> Prioritized feature POJO  (Fowler et al) Enterprise POJO (#GeekCruise) 1 Understandability Modifiability 2 Simplicity Understandability 3 Modifiability ~~Simplicity~~ AsSimpleAsPossible <p>The reasons why we have a change in the prioritization for enterprise POJOs are</p> <ul> <li>They are by default remote (By this we mean that their common characteristics is that they are used across system boundaries, not that they necessary extends serializable or provide remote proxies)</li> <li>They have more external dependencies.

You will also find that it often makes sense to split a service for a domain object into a CRUD (master) service and a accompanying Query Service to keep the complexity to a manageable level, and to allow a more feature rich query interface.

Intro Service Oriented Architecture is all over us. There seems to be some kind of consensus that one type of SOA services are services that are responsible for the core business objects - and vendors are monitoring and releasing their SOA Data Server products to close the gap. By pioneering the SOA space with EDR, we have gained lots of valuable of experiences of how to solve the Master Data challenges in SOA. The problem  - Companies don't have a precise view about their data - Projects define data reconciliation outside project scope - Developers do not care about data - Vendors always try to solve to much at once - The data warehouse guys have beards and funny accents   NB. The problems description needs major rework - most people does not get the message. possibly by using some example cases.. The vision To solve the data problems in the simplest and most flexible way and at the same time provide a solid building block on the way to enable the Real Time Enterprise vision for a service-oriented System Strategy. EDR-MDS is primed to be the best strategy to move to SOA Maturity Level 2. (SOA Maturity Models and EDR-MDS) EDR-MDS To allow standard software to coexist nicely with SOA, we need to master our disjoint Business Objects (EDR sources)\u200f EDR is the natural, simple and inexpensive choice for a Master Strategy for Business Objects.  Highlights   - Field/value based mastering (dynamic readable rules(DSL))\u200f - Auto-update/write-back to all involved parties (using the standard provider)\u200f - Out-of bounds mastering/overwrite to leverage the most of all applications - Out-of-bounds triggers for each provider   Backbones   - JavaSpace (Blitz) - EDA/Eventing - Federated backbones - Distributed cache   Tooling   - JMatter Domain Object Management Client  Mastering with EDR Initial discussions identified some core concepts related to mastering strategies. These concepts requires definitions in this context:   - Master - Synchronization - Mapping - Complex Validation   All mastering strategies are primarily focused towards categorized Core Services implementing Enterprise Domain Repository and utilizing multiple providers. Key takeaways  - Simplest possible route to managed data - Reduced complexity by zooming in to one single Business Object at a time - All non-business object relations handled as resource references. - Simple first generation implementation within 2-3 months - By adding support for managed Business Objects in your SOA, you facilitate and enable event-driven architectures and real- time enterprise. - Value Delivered - Business Cases There is no such thing as magic EDR-MDS is just good old common sense  - EDR-MDS can be implemented in your favorite technology, container, product or programming language.

They bring fundamental challenges to discrete systems, since they exhibit noncontinuous behavior, often embody a combinatorial explosion of state space, and may be corrupted by unexpected external events. Furthermore, as a discipline we lack the mathematical tools and as humans we fall short of the intellectual capacity to model the behavior of ultralarge discrete systems.

Whenever companies add new enterprise applications to \"manage\" data, they unwittingly contribute to an overall confusion about a corporation's overall view of the enterprise. As a result, the concept of master data management (MDM)~~-~~creating a single, unified view of an organization{-}--is growing in importance.  Read more.. |</p> <p>|  | From MSDN \"The What, Why, and How of Master Data Management\" Here is a typical master-data horror story: A credit-card customer moves from 2847 North 9th St. to 1001 11th St. North. The customer changed his billing address immediately, but did not receive a bill for several months. One day, the customer received a threatening phone call from the credit-card billing department, asking why the bill has not been paid. The customer verifies that they have the new address, and the billing department verifies that the address on file is 1001 11th St. N. The customer asks for a copy of the bill, to settle the account. After two more weeks without a bill, the customer calls back and finds the account has been turned over to a collection agency. This time, they find out that even though the address in the file was 1001 11th St. N, the billing address is 101 11th St. N. After a bunch of phone calls and letters between lawyers, the bill finally gets resolved and the credit-card company has lost a customer for life. In this case, the master copy of the data was accurate, but another copy of it was flawed. Master data must be both correct and consistent.

In the race to web 2.0 or enterprise 2.0 enable today's enterprises, many of the internal systems are experiencing explosion in load. At the same time, most successful web 2.0 companies have been very open with their internal architecture and experiences. This workshop intend to kill a few myths and establish a baseline for architectural options for scalable systems in 2009. By publicizing this guide, we hope to help developers and architects to make better decisions in how to plan and build for these new scalability challenges.

The transition to XAML-based user interfaces is underway, and most developers are still using UI design principles from the 1990s. With new degrees of freedom, it's time to throw away obsolete conventions and find new ways to make users productive and happy. That means getting back to the basics on fundamental principles of user interface design. In this session, we'll do a ground-zero discussion of the design principles around animation, spatial arrangements, interaction patterns, colors, fonts, and more. To explain these design processes in a more concrete manner, the approach will depend heavily on how the user's brain wiring helps us understand the way to think about design.

Fra \u00e5 v\u00e6re den neste hypen alle skulle inn p\u00e5, er \"fenomenet\" i ferd med \u00e5 bli et skjellsord i enkelte kretser. Seneste fra forrige IASA m\u00f8tet hvor det ble trukket fram at det verste en arkitekt kan gj\u00f8re er \u00e5 \"dytte en ESB p\u00e5 oss utviklere\".  Fra foredragsholder: \"Jeg er klar over at det er mange som har et anstrengt forhold til SOA -og jeg har planlagt \u00e5 ta utgangspunkt i noe kritikken som har kommet frem.\"  Speaker: Christian Hilmersen, NSA   ---   Enterprise Domain Repository som integrasjonstrategi  Alle bedrifter har en infrastruktur hvor de samme data er duplisert mellom forskjellige systemer, s\u00e5 som kunderegister, CRM eller supportdatabase. Samtidig er data spredt mellom disse systemene. N\u00e5r vi jobber med domeneobjekter s\u00e5 er det viktig \u00e5 hente denne infromasjonen raskt, og med dataintegritet. Enterprise Domain Repository (EDR)  h\u00e5ndterer disse komplekse domeneobjektene med informasjon fra flere kjernesystemer. I foredraget vil B\u00e5rd forklare konseptet bak EDR, hvilke verkt\u00f8y som finnes, og hva vi m\u00e5 bygge selv. Eksempler vil vise hva EDR har l\u00f8st, og hvordan vi kan bruke EDR til \u00e5 l\u00f8se noen av v\u00e5re integrasjonproblemer.

EDR som integrasjonstrategi  ---   Intelligente dokumentarkiv - finnes de? - Praktisk bruk av Enterprise Information Integration  En utfordring i en hver integrasjonsl\u00f8sning er \u00e5 sikre at akt\u00f8rene i l\u00f8sningen har nok informasjon til \u00e5 kunne utnytte tjenestene som eksponeres. En metode for \u00e5 oppn\u00e5 dette er Enterprise Information Integration (EII).  \"Enterprise Information Integration or EII, is a process of information integration, using data abstraction to provide a single interface (known as uniform data access) for viewing all the data within an organization, and a single set of structures and naming conventions (known as uniform information representation) to represent this data; the goal of EII is to get a large set of heterogeneous data sources to appear to a user or system as a single, homogeneous data\"   - [source.en.wikipedia.org] - 1. mai 2010   Den dynamiske datastrukturen i semantisk teknlogogi, og spessialt emnekart, er meget godt egnet til \u00e5 eksponere denne typen funksjonalitet.

Oslo.pm (Perl utvikling) Practical Tips for Rakudo Star  Perl 6 has been under development for many years. \"Rakudo\" is the Perl 6 implementation on top of the Parrot virtual machine, and it about to have its first release defined as \"usable\" by its main developers. This release is called Rakudo * (Star).  In this talk Rune will show you how to get hold of Rakudo, tell you ways Perl 6 will be quicker to program in than Perl 5 and other languages, and give an idea on how it can help you avoid bugs in your code.  Speaker: Karl Rune Nilsen  Talk language: Norwegian  Rune has used Perl for very large web systems since 1996. Rune enjoys reducing the complexity and bugcounts of large systems by applying principles of functional languages, following the development of Rakudo Perl, cold beer and long walks on the beach. He currently works as a consultant at Redpill Linpro AS.   ---   Perl - a bit like Ruby, but with a usable object system  Ruby first came to my attention as a neat little language that attempted to put lisp, Perl, and smalltalk in a bag and shake - and ended up with a rather beautiful result.  Since then, the state of the art of Perl 5 OO has come on in leaps and bounds - drawing inspiration from ruby, rakudo, CLOS and ML among others in the process.  And now every time I look at ruby again I try and find the equivalent metaprogramming and re-use capabilities and ... they aren't there. I keep thinking \"is this it?\" - I'm reminded of meeting PHP4 and wondering where the hell the closures were.  So in this talk I'm going to give you a guided tour of the Moose meta OO syntax extension system and its associated metaprotocol, and the nearest equivalents I've been able to find in ruby.  Hopefully those who value OO and metaprogramming over language choice will take another look at Perl, those who're scared of $ signs will consider wholesale theft of ideas in the grandest traditions of open source, and those who know better than me will heckle and tell me what I got wrong.  And most importantly, hopefully we'll have fun learning something new about OO together  Speaker: Matt S. Trout  Talk language: English  Matt is a co-maintainer of the Catalyst web framework, the creator of the DBIx::Class ORM, a core team member for the Moose project, and contributor to several other CPAN projects. He's a frequent speaker at conferences, and well known in the Perl community for his colourful presentations.  Bio: http://www.shadowcat.co.uk/resources/bios/matt_short/ NNUG (Norwegian .NET user Group) Energimerkesystem for NVE (energimerking.no)  Vi har laget et system for NVE for energimerking av bygninger. Dette er basert p\u00e5 informasjon som brukerne oppgir. Attest fra dette systemet skal brukes ved salg og utleie av boliger.  Systemet har integrasjon med Altinn, MinID og Mattrikkel. Det brukes flere MS teknologier: ASP.Net, Windows Workflow, WCF, SharePoint Excel Services, SQL Server med Reporting Services.  Vi bruker Excel Services som beregningsmotor, systemet kan importere alle grunnlags data fra Excel ark. All grunnlags data legges inn i biblioteker som er versjonert.  Speaker: Shiraz Bhaiji Shiraz jobber i EDB Consulting Group.   ---   Ordrebehandlingssystem for Reinertsen byggherre  Reinertsen bestillingssystem skal hjelpe kunden \u00e5 f\u00e5 kontroll over bestillinger og forpliktelser den har gjort i forhold til sine leverand\u00f8rer og sine kunder.  Brukergrensesnittet er rollestyrt og intuitivt.  Oslo kommune som den st\u00f8rste kunden p\u00e5 \u00d8stlandet har satt krav ovenfor Reinertsen for \u00e5 skaffe oversikt over varer og tjenester brukt p\u00e5 byggeprosjekter.  Systemet skal p\u00e5 sikt integrere med \u00f8konomi systemet for \u00e5 sikre at arbeidsflyt og arbeidsprosesser er fulgt opp i alle ledd.

Foredraget vil gi eksempler p\u00e5 hvordan Scala Actors kan brukes  og hvorfor actors kan gj\u00f8re flertr\u00e5dsprogrammer enklere, raskere og  mer robuste.  Speaker: Espen Berger Espen Berger jobber til daglig med produktutvikling i TANDBERG og skriver kode og jobbber med arkitektur. De siste 5 \u00e5rene har han jobbet med asynkrone og eventdrevne systemer i C#, Java og Scala.   ---   Nytt i Scala 2.8, ferskt fra scaladays  Vi kommer til \u00e5 g\u00e5 gjennom noen av de nye tingene man n\u00e5 kan gj\u00f8re med Scala som Named and default arguments, @Specialized, Package objects, Implicit parameters, Improved anotations, Continuations, bedre mulighet for compiler integrasjon og mye mer. Vi skal ta for oss de spr\u00e5kendringene som vi mener er mest interessante og vise noen kodeeksempler p\u00e5 hva de inneb\u00e6rer. Vi vil ogs\u00e5 viderefortelle hvordan mange av disse tingene fungerer under panseret, siden konferansen i stor grad var f\u00f8rsteh\u00e5ndsfortellinger fra de phd. studentene som har laget dem.

Har planer om \u00e5 blande inn litt Scala i miksen snart.   ---   Scala og Clojure  Clojure er et dynamisk spr\u00e5k som kj\u00f8rer p\u00e5 JVM. Det er en Lisp  dialekt, med fokus p\u00e5 funksjonell programmering. Dette foredraget vil  gi en innf\u00f8ring i Clojure, med fokus p\u00e5 de egenskapene som gj\u00f8r  spr\u00e5ket annerledes enn Scala og andre JVM spr\u00e5k. Eksempler brukes for  \u00e5 illustrere de forskjellige aspektene.  Speaker: Eivind Barstad Waaler Eivind jobber i BEKK, som leder for Java-gruppen. Det siste \u00e5ret har han jobbet med en masteroppgave sentrert rundt alternative JVM-spr\u00e5k som Scala, Clojure og (J)Ruby.   ---   Simple Build Tool  Simple Build Tool er et byggeverkt\u00f8y for Scala, skrevet i Scala, der  du ogs\u00e5 skriver Scala for \u00e5 definere byggen din.

Openly available implementations of various services, tools and frameworks - developed and refined over time, based on the experience of people using them in anger.  3. Deployment examples - reference information concerning the ways in which JavaSpaces and JINI technologies have been applied in the real world. These will be useful to both architects and administrators.  We believe that the best way to achieve the above is in an open, co-operative manner thus Blitz is an OpenSource project.

But when the company doesn't sincerely accept the change in work style, the result is just a buzzword for the usual project hell, as Charlie Martin's story about an agile project gone wrong describes:</p> <p>Sometimes, your friends tell you hard things. If you think you're doing Agile, you must step back every so often and ask: Can I respond to changing requirements easily? Do I have confidence that I could run the current build and see part of the system work? Am I seeing my family on a regular basis? Or did we plan to work overtime over Christmas to make our commitments? If you aren't seeing easy response to change, regular working deliveries and a regular schedule with a normal workweek, you have a cargo cult...</p> <p>Cargo cults developed in Melanesia, starting in the 19th century, but really grew during World War II. To the locals, the war meant cargo planes and cargo ships arriving, carrying everything from canned pineapple to Quonset huts. And it was good... Then the war ended, and the cargo stopped. The locals responded by building their own runways, with airplanes made of bamboo and palm fronds, in hopes of attracting it back.</p> <p>Martin's experience relates to a project that wanted to follow agile principles, but also had to fit into existing corporate standards and processes. Some agile principles were compromised, and although the project did deliver, it was late, cost more than anticipated, and was not much different in the end from a traditional waterfall project.</p>"},{"location":"dev/Cargo-Cult/#what-does-a-cargo-cult-agile-shop-look-like-1","title":"What does a cargo cult agile shop look like? [1]","text":"<p>From the outside, it may look a lot like an actual agile shop. After all, a cargo cult shop is imitating what they have seen about agile. However, like waterfall proponents, cargo cult agile shops are led by people who have looked at pictures of agile models, \"read\" agile books, or \"learned\" agile development from PowerPoint presentations. Perhaps there are a number of developers who know agile, but they may not be able to move the company towards agility in the face of generations of managers and developers who have been indoctrinated by DoD-2167.</p> <p>By definition, agility describes an ability to respond to changes. As such, any agile process is going to have some sort of iterative process in which the software is improved and responds to any changes that have occurred during development. In a cargo cult shop, keep a particular eye out for iterations that don't include tasks other than programming. If the details of analysis, design, and testing are excluded, you are probably looking at a \"cowboy\" project or a waterfall project in disguise. An iteration should always include or consider changes. While possible, it is unlikely that the project will remain completely unchanged after an iteration.</p> <p>With any agile process, the speed and effectiveness of adapting to change is the primary measure of how agile your team has become. If you are using an effective agile process, responding to change should be graceful. If a change causes a lot of disruption, or re-visiting a line of code that someone has already typed causes alarms to go off, you may be in a cargo cult.</p> <p>If you are looking at a potential agile company, look at their process in as much detail as they will allow during the interview. If they use XP, ask to look at story cards. Do their unit tests actually test the functionality, or are they a check box to get past a sign-off? Are the story cards simply a requirements document created in one big design up front or do they add, change, and remove cards as they get further into the project. On a scrum project, ask how long a typical scrum meeting lasts. If their idea of a daily scrum is two hours, run, don't walk, to your next interview because they have missed the point entirely.</p> <p>If you are already in a cargo cult agile shop challenge your process. Good agile process encourages a constant feedback loop regarding both your product and your process. If an agile process isn't working look into why and fix it. Go past the powerpoint presentations and the diagrams. Reproduce the results that created the processes you are attempting to emulate. If the agile process is printed and bound, and they haven't made a single change to it in five years, it is highly likely they have not challenged and enhanced their process to fit their people.</p> <p>Some agile models are a toolkit and give guidance on how to effectively use them, while other methodologies require practices to be used together to achieve a result. Some practices stand on their own while others may be interdependent. Understand the benefits and consequences of cherry picking from agile, especially if you are doing a project waterfall style.</p>"},{"location":"dev/Cargo-Cult/#agile-as-a-cult-1","title":"Agile as a Cult [1]","text":"<p>I am a fan of agile development in general because the Agile movement formally questioned and rejected the dogma of how software development should be done and, in particular, challenged the continuously failing waterfall model. Agile is just a step along the way and isn't without fault and dogma itself. We sorely need to keep moving towards improving our understanding of successful software development.</p> <p>Post-agilism is starting to take hold with a tempered view, absent much of the hype and absolutism that has formed in some Agile communities. I look forward to the thoughts of these people who refuse to be constrained by dogma and continually challenge how we write software.

It is used to describe manufacturing systems that are based on pull as opposed to push. For example: Dell only orders the parts from it supply chain network for the computers customers have already ordered. Toyota has the same approach with the orders from its distributers. Similarly, at Toyota plants, operators are supplied with new parts as their buffers run low, by using a card to signal the \"kanban train\".</p> <p>Software is not like manufacture. Especially not the way it works today! But we do produce something: Features that hopefully have value.</p> <p>A kanban system for software pulls activity from the single most highly prioritized feature.</p> <p>If your currently are trying to get your release cycle down from years or several months to weeks, kanban is not for you. If you can deliver frequently, you might consider feature-boxing instead of time-boxing. Kanban is basically feature-boxing with a very small box.</p> <p>As Arlo Belshee describes it kanban software development takes one marketable feature at a time and completes it all the way to production and actual use by actual customers. If you can do this, product backlogs and even estimation becomes waste (or, in lean jargon, muda - \u7121\u99c4). Instead of trying to guess how big something is, measure how much value was produced per work hour.</p> <p>Kanban gives you less waste, greater customer responsiveness, both in terms of speed and value.

F\u00f8rst av alt vil jeg takke dere for at dere st\u00f8ttet Smidig 2009 som sponsor. For tredje \u00e5ret p\u00e5 rad ble fjor\u00e5rets Smidig-konferanse en s\u00e6rdeles vellykket begivenhet. N\u00e6rmere 500 deltakere fikk to l\u00e6rerike dager med lyntaler og open space-diskusjoner. Lyntalene ble filmet og gjort fritt tilgjengelig for alle p\u00e5 http://tcs.java.no/. Nettsidene for fjor\u00e5rets konferanse finner man p\u00e5 http://smidig2009.no/.</p> <p>Konferansen ble i 2009 avholdt i Oslo Kongressenter. P\u00e5 grunn av \u00f8nsket om \u00e5 kunne vokse litt, har vi i \u00e5r besluttet \u00e5 flytte til Radisson Blu Scandinavia Hotel. Vi vil i stor grad f\u00f8lge tidligere \u00e5rs format og konsepter, og vil i \u00e5r ogs\u00e5 vurdere \u00e5 inkludere noen kjente navn. Vi satser p\u00e5 \u00e5 \u00f8ke antallet deltagere litt fra ifjor. Informasjon om konferansen blir \u00e5 finne p\u00e5 http://smidig2010.no/.</p> <p>Som tidligere arrangeres konferansen av frivillige entusiaster, og finansieres av deltageravgift og sponsormidler fra firmaer som \u00f8nsker \u00f8kt fokus p\u00e5 smidige metoder. I dagens markedssituasjon synes fokuset p\u00e5 smidig systemvikling \u00e5 v\u00e6re enda viktigere enn tidligere. Som sponsor for Smidig 2010 viser dere at dere satser p\u00e5 metoder som gir kostnadseffektivitet og god kvalitet. Tidligere konferanser har hatt mange deltagere fra viktige kunder som NRK, NAV, BBS, DnB NOR, Statens Pensjonskasse og Finn.no.</p> <p>Tidligere har vi sagt at det er viktig \u00e5 understreke at smidige metoder ikke er \u00e9n enkelt bedrifts kommersialiserte tanker og ideer, men derimot tankegodset til en hel bevegelse innenfor IT. Dette er ogs\u00e5 utgangspunktet for Smidig 2010. Vi \u00f8nsker at konferansen skal forbli et spleiselag, hvor alle sponsorer blir tilegnet like mye plass og oppmerksomhet. \u00c5 v\u00e6re sponsor for Smidig 2010 er et sterkt signal om at dere stiller seg bak bevegelsen for smidige metoder og st\u00f8tter opp under det frivillige initiativet som er drivkraften bak arrangement. Alle sponsormidlene g\u00e5r direkte inn i konferansens drift.</p> <p>Sponsorene g\u00e5r inn med kroner 25 000,- hver og f\u00e5r for dette f\u00f8lgende:</p> <ul> <li>Bedriftens logo p\u00e5 konferansens hjemmeside</li> <li>Bedriftens logo p\u00e5 alle trykksaker til konferansen (plakater, flyveblader, program)</li> <li>Bedriftens logo p\u00e5 eventuell annonsering, for eksempel i Computerworld</li> <li>Hederlig omtale i konferansens \u00e5pningstale</li> <li>Rett til \u00e5 benytte Smidig 2010 i bedriftens markedsf\u00f8ring</li> <li>To deltakerbilletter til konferansen</li> <li>Mulighet til \u00e5 ha en pullup i fellesrom under konferanse</li> <li>Mulighet til \u00e5 gj\u00f8re ett A4-ark med informasjon om bedriften tilgjengelig for alle deltakerne under konferansen</li> </ul> <p>Dersom dere \u00f8nsker \u00e5 sponse konferansen, trenger vi en fakturaadresse og to logoer.

That is, all modules have the same release cycle and they share configuration from the Parent POM. The relationship between the POMs are thus that the modules are referenced from the parent with the module element AND the modules reference the parent with the parent element. So what is the purpose of this project setup?</p> <p>Like any modularization concept the module makes it easier to adhere to the principle of high cohesion, low coupling . With Java packages an import is required to use code from another package. With Maven modules it is necessary to explicitly add a dependency to the other module to be able to use code from it, just like a dependency to any other Maven artifact. This makes the coupling between modules explicit, and the build will break if you create circular dependencies.</p> <p>A additional - positive - side-effect is that modules make it easier to identify code blocks that can be reused. Code that should be shared between projects with different release cycles need to be refactoring into a standalone Maven project, and it is easier to set up a separate project if the code is located in a cohesive module. See more reasons in the FAQ .</p> <p>|  | A word of caution Be wary of over-engineering by creating too many modules. Code with good structure is easier to re-use, but sometimes re-use is not on the agenda (YAGNI). Remember also that trying to enforce larger moves can result in project friction. You should always take into account the culture and skill set of your project team.

Test mode - Setup a separate UIB and LDAP behind firewall. - Download the docker image and change the user identity backend configuration to point to your UIB - All in one server or with separate UIB and Front end 3. Production mode - Get a SSL certificate for the domain you wish to run whydah on, i.e. sso.whydah.net - Setup a separate UIB and LDAP behind firewall. - Setup a separate front-end server with UAS, UAWA and STS.

They even complain when it proves difficult because all those \"enterprise features\" aren't present. Why does this happen?</p> <p>I believe it's because these developers have fundamentally misunderstood how cloud computing delivers its benefits. They see the cheap prices but don't stop to consider where the cost saving comes from. Some of it is achieved by cloud platform vendors getting large discounts on huge hardware orders but a significant proportion comes from the fact that they don't need to provide (via human resources or APIs) the sysadmin functions required for conventional hosting solutions.</p> <p>Quite simply typical applications, their architectures and associated administration practices are not setup for cloud platforms. Some of them may be able to run on these platforms with sufficient hackery, brute force and associated cost. However if the motivation for a move to the cloud is merely to reduce kit costs one might well be better off looking for a cheaper conventional hosting solution.</p> <p>In summary, making the best of the cloud requires that we take an architectural view, something that we've proven remarkably bad at over and over.

The interfaces hide the implementation details and enable a completely automated response by the provider of the service to the consumer of the service. The service could be considered \"ready to use\" or \"off the shelf\" because the service is designed to serve the specific needs of a set of consumers, and the technologies are tailored to that need rather than the service being tailored to how the technology works. The articulation of the service feature is based on service levels and IT outcomes (availability, response time, performance versus price, and clear and predefined operational processes), rather than technology and its capabilities. In other words, what the service needs to do is more important than how the technologies are used to implement the solution.</p> <p>Scalable and Elastic: The service can scale capacity up or down as the consumer demands at the speed of full automation (which may be seconds for some services and hours for others). Elasticity is a trait of shared pools of resources. Scalability is a feature of the underlying infrastructure and software platforms. Elasticity is associated with not only scale but also an economic model that enables scaling in both directions in an automated fashion. This means that services scale on demand to add or remove resources as needed.</p> <p>Shared: Services share a pool of resources to build economies of scale. IT resources are used with maximum efficiency. The underlying infrastructure, software or platforms are shared among the consumers of the service (usually unknown to the consumers). This enables unused resources to serve multiple needs for multiple consumers, all working at the same time.</p> <p>Metered by Use: Services are tracked with usage metrics to enable multiple payment models. The service provider has a usage accounting model for measuring the use of the services, which could then be used to create different pricing plans and models. These may include pay-as-you go plans, subscriptions, fixed plans and even free plans. The implied payment plans will be based on usage, not on the cost of the equipment. These plans are based on the amount of the service used by the consumers, which may be in terms of hours, data transfers or other use-based attributes delivered.</p> <p>Uses Internet Technologies: The service is delivered using Internet identifiers, formats and protocols, such as URLs, HTTP, IP and representational state transfer Web-oriented architecture. Many examples of Web technology exist as the foundation for Internet-based services. Google's Gmail, Amazon.com's book buying, eBay's auctions and Lolcats' picture sharing all exhibit the use of Internet and Web technologies and protocols.</p>"},{"location":"~totto/2009_09_/","title":"Thor Henning Hetland Blog from September, 2009","text":"<p>I've had some discussions on the greenness of Cloud Computing the last few weeks.
